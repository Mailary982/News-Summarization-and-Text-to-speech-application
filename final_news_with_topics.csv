About

Vibe Coding refers to a slang term coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy to describe AI-dependant programming in which a person uses LLM assistants like Cursor AI to generate code instead of writing it themselves. This method of coding marks a shift from programmers manually coding and debugging software to programmers writing prompts and then testing and refining AI-generated source code. The term ""vibe coding"" gained traction in early 2025 after reports emerged that 25 percent of the Winter 2025 Y Combinator batch relied on 95 percent AI-generated code and college professors and software managers shared stories of dealing with young AI-reliant vibe coders.

Origin

On February 2nd, 2025, Open AI co-founder and former AI leader at Tesla Andrej Karpathy made a post on X defining the phrase ""vibe coding,"" describing it as ""a new kind of coding."" Karpathy wrote that he uses his preferred AI coding tool Cursor Composer via voice command and ""barely even touches the keyboard,"" and that even though this method was not perfect, ""I just see things, say things, run things, and copy-paste things, and it mostly works.""

The post gathered over 27,000 likes in a month and led to a series of discussions about a new crop of AI-reliant programmers now given the title, ""vibe coders.""

Spread

Several internet users reacted to Karpathy's tweet in early February 2025 by quoting his post with memes, as seen in a tweet by X user @IterIntellectus that uses the Rick Rubin Headphones meme to joke about what vibe coding feels like. The post gathered over 3,000 likes in a month.

On February 12th, Twitter / X user @rileybrown_ai shared a tweet captioned, ""15 rules of vibe coding with Cursor,"" listing some best practices to help ""vibe coders"" create a functioning and usable codebase using AI-coding software like Cursor. The tweet gathered over 10,000 likes in a month.

However, by mid-February 2025, several internet users noted an increase in ""vibe coders"" who were unable to manage, understand or debug their code.

For instance, on February 13th, X user @Brycicle77 reposted a January 27th post to Reddit's /r/ChatGPTCoding subreddit that read, ""So, I made a project in python entirely using Cursor (composer) and Claude, but it has gotten to a point that the whole codebase is over 30 Python files, code is super disorganized, might even have duplicate loops, and Claude keeps forgetting basic stuff like imports at this point.""

On March 3rd, 2025, X user @catalinmpit posted a Desert Dilemma meme alongside text that reads, ""Vibe coding is easy. Vibe debugging is the hard part."" The post gathered over 5,000 likes in two weeks.

On March 16th, 2025, Redditor /u/mechanic338 made a post to the subreddit /r/ProgrammerHumor that read, ""Say vibe coding one more time."" The post gathered over 1,900 upvotes in three days.

On March 15th, X user @qtnx_ shared a Oppenheimer Stare of Regret meme alongside text that read, ""how karpathy felt after realizing he kickstarted a new wave of grifting by tweeting this,"" gathering over 5,000 likes in four days.

Tesla,“What do I look for?” Promise and pitfalls in buying a used EV,"“They’re super quiet, fast and responsive,” said Clark, the operations manager for an engineering firm who lives in North Vancouver. “EVs are really fun to drive.”

Her initial motivation in buying the EV was reduced emissions and the circular logic of investing in a used car, but like so many first-time EV drivers, she was soon hooked on more than the prospect of bypassing gas stations.

That compared to an average list price of $70,297 for a new BEV, down 5.7 per cent during the same period.

The average price of a used battery electric vehicle (BEV) on AutoTrader.ca – home to more than 400,000 vehicles – fell to $42,398 in February, a 16.3 per cent year-over-year decline, said Baris Akyurek, vice president, insights and intelligence at the website.

Since her 2023 purchase, the economics of buying a used EV have continued to look bright.

Budget-minded consumers might consider buying now rather than later.

The impact of the Trump tariffs on North American supply chains could slow new auto production overall and push prices higher, forcing some buyers into the used market, said Akyurek.

“We are seeing a little bit of an uptick already in new car prices,” he said of their data for the first six days of March.

A few years ago, COVID disrupted auto supply chains and forced new car prices higher. That led to a 21.7 per spike in used car prices in 2021 as many buyers shifted into the used market.

Buying a used EV starts with doing your homework.

In the lead-up to buying her Hyundai, Clark made it her mission to understand as much as she could about the upside and potential pitfalls of buying an EV with 40,000 km on the odometer.

Her first step was to approach the Vancouver Electric Vehicle Association (VEVA), a not-for-profit group that works to get more British Columbians into EVs.

The group includes EV-owner enthusiasts with a broad range of experience who can answer first-time buyer questions. Clark perused VEVA summaries for all the EVs and hybrids on the market, listed by price, which was the starting point for working out what her family was willing to pay.

“I went to a meeting, and basically asked them, what am I looking for and what do I look out for?” she recalled.

Clark’s next stop was AutoTrader.ca to set up a search filter to screen for EVs in her chosen age and price range. Over a few months, she got a good sense of what kinds of EVs were on the market.

“We decided we wanted to go through a dealer because we wanted to have a battery test and a service history,” she said, as opposed to buying from a private seller. The Hyundai’s battery was still at a 100 per cent state of health. A test drive sealed the deal.

Her family already owns a Mitsubishi Outlander plug-in hybrid which they can use for long summer road trips. The used EV is perfect for everything else: including trips to work, shopping and hockey practices for their son. Their house has an EV charger installed in the garage.

EV on a fixed budget

Unlike the Clark family, whose EV is the most active vehicle in their busy two-car family life, East Vancouverite Wally Kunz bought his used Chevy Spark as a retirement car.

Similar to Clark, the reduction in emissions from transportation was the critical initial motivation, as was the lower price.

“We couldn’t afford a new Tesla, and we couldn’t afford a new Leaf,” said the 77-year old retired engineer.

What he could afford was a 2015 Spark with 33,000 km, which he and his wife Robin bought in 2020. Kunz found it on AutoTrader, and purchased the vehicle from a Chevrolet dealership.

The Kunz family drove a Honda Civic for 25 years, but near the end it cost $3,000 a year to keep on the road.

Critical to making the new purchase on their fixed budget was the credit they received from the dealership for their old vehicle. They also received cash from BC’s SCRAP-IT!, an incentive program that encourages consumers to ditch their gas beaters for zero emission vehicles.

They have a level one charger in their garage, the slowest of three currently available EV charging modes, which delivers a full charge overnight. They don’t notice the “EV bump” on their hydro bill, and Robin adds with satisfaction that the smelly oil stains on their garage floor are gone too.

One piece of advice Kunz has for used EV buyers, something that they did not do, is to get a full report on the battery health before buying the vehicle.

For many EV models, a phone app, such as the Nissan Leaf-specific Leaf Spy, works with a small ODB adapter which connects to a socket just under the vehicle’s dashboard, enabling the driver to see a visualization of the battery health data.

“We didn’t do that, but we were lucky,” he said. “We still have about 90 per cent of the original range after nine years. In summertime, we get about 100 km in range, which is all we need.”

Anyone who has shopped for a used internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle will already know some of the advantages of a used EV: it costs less and the original buyer bears the brunt of depreciation. One used EV buyer told Canada’s National Observer the purchase of a 2023 Hyundai IONIQ saved him at least $12,000.

With few moving parts to maintain, the cost of upkeep is close to zero and the vehicle pays for itself from gas savings over time. But similar to a used ICE vehicle, there’s the risk of an unknown daily driving history.

Because an EV is essentially a giant battery, questions about battery health, including range and integrity of range over time, loom even larger over used EVs than new ones.

For Montrealer Ken Dyson, battery issues influenced his decision last year to buy a new Kia EV6 Land GT Line 2024.

“As for buying a used EV, I was not comfortable with that. My understanding of battery tech had me skeptical of battery life depending on how the previous owner took care of it,” Dyson said.

“For instance, high speed DC charging can reduce battery life, and so can over-charging, or letting it fall below 20 per cent frequently. So, until I can be convinced that I would have long battery life, I would rather not get used,” he added.

On a recent November day trip from Montreal to the Eastern townships to visit friends, Dyson drove the 220 km round trip with battery left to spare. There was zero range anxiety.

“Battery math”

Another factor pushing Quebec owners like Dyson to purchase new are Canada’s richest provincial government subsidies at $7,000 per vehicle last year. This has contributed to Quebec’s status as the province with the most EVs, ahead of B.C. and Ontario in third place.

But Quebec’s subsidies for fully electric vehicles will drop to $4,000 in 2025 before lowering to $2,000 by 2026 – with the program set to end in 2027.

Virtually all subsidies for EVs in Canada are for new vehicles only — although B.C.’s SCRAP IT! program applies to used vehicles, and B.C. currently does not charge PST on used EVs.

The Seattle-based company provides a ""range score"" for an EV's battery, accounting for factors like temperature, age, charging habits and driving style (source: Recurrent)

Aside from a detailed battery report, there are two more things to consider before you buy, said Andrew Garberson, head of growth and research at Recurrent, a Seattle-based platform providing consumers and car dealerships with information about used EV batteries.

First, if you find a used EV you like enough to test drive, he suggests doing some simple battery math.

If the console tells you, for example, that the car has 80 per cent charge left on the battery, and you know it has a certain range, make sure the battery reading accurately reflects that at the end of the test drive. If the battery reading drops down to 50 per cent after a 10-minute test drive, there’s a problem.

His second piece of advice is to “understand that these batteries last much longer than most people expect.”

In Canada, the minimum government-mandated warranty for battery electric drivetrains is eight years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first.

“In all the research that we’ve done, less than two per cent of the cars have had a battery replaced, and we study cars that are up to 12 years old now,” Garberson said.

“The manufacturers created warranties that would protect both the consumer and themselves. Nobody wants to have to pay for an expensive EV battery replacement or repair,” he added.

A lot of used EV buyers right now are buying vehicles in the two-to-four year-old range, so they are well within warranty.

“I love this car”

Not that everyone has anxiety about replacing an EV battery.

Burnaby’s Rick Jang is a recently-retired heavy mechanic who spent his entire working life around emission-spewing ICE machines of every description. But in 2018, he bought a three-year old Nissan Leaf with 33,000 kms of mileage.

After six years of driving 51,000 kms, he only has changed three wiper blades and the electrical coolant. His brakes are still at 80 per cent, and he said the gas savings have more than paid for the vehicle.

A climate skeptic, Jang did not buy the vehicle to cut emissions: “I bought it because I didn’t want to pay $2 for a litre of gas.”

His 10-year-old used EV can still get 150 km range, but the battery warranty is long past. Jang plans to eventually buy a Chinese battery pack and hire a dealer to install it at a cost of around $6,000 or maybe less by the time it happens..

“If my battery lasts another five years, I will order in a [new] battery pack, because I love this car.”","“They’re super quiet, fast and responsive,” said Clark, the operations manager for an engineering firm who lives in North Vancouver. “EVs are really fun to drive.” Her initial motivation in buying the EV was reduced emissions and the circular logic of investing in a used car, but like so many first-time EV drivers, she was soon hooked on more than the prospect of bypassing gas stations.

For many EV models, a phone app, such as the Nissan Leaf-specific Leaf Spy, works with a small ODB adapter which connects to a socket just under the vehicle’s dashboard, enabling the driver to see a visualization of the battery health data. “We didn’t do that, but we were lucky,” he said. “We still have about 90 per cent of the original range after nine years. In summertime, we get about 100 km in range, which is all we need.” EV owner Don Barthel's post to the BC EV Owners Group on Facebook. He recommended first-time buyers use an app to check the battery health of a used EV (Screenshot from Facebook, Dec. 2024) Anyone who has shopped for a used internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle will already know some of the advantages of a used EV: it costs less and the original buyer bears the brunt of depreciation. One used EV buyer told Canada’s National Observer the purchase of a 2023 Hyundai IONIQ saved him at least $12,000. With few moving parts to maintain, the cost of upkeep is close to zero and the vehicle pays for itself from gas savings over time. But similar to a used ICE vehicle, there’s the risk of an unknown daily driving history. Because an EV is essentially a giant battery, questions about battery health, including range and integrity of range over time, loom even larger over used EVs than new ones. Top three concerns about buying a used EV, according to a 2024 survey of consumers by AutoTrader, an online auto marketplace. (Source: AutoTrader.ca) For Montrealer Ken Dyson, battery issues influenced his decision last year to buy a new Kia EV6 Land GT Line 2024. “As for buying a used EV, I was not comfortable with that. My understanding of battery tech had me skeptical of battery life depending on how the previous owner took care of it,” Dyson said. “For instance, high speed DC charging can reduce battery life, and so can over-charging, or letting it fall below 20 per cent frequently. So, until I can be convinced that I would have long battery life, I would rather not get used,” he added. On a recent November day trip from Montreal to the Eastern townships to visit friends, Dyson drove the 220 km round trip with battery left to spare. There was zero range anxiety. “Battery math” Another factor pushing Quebec owners like Dyson to purchase new are Canada’s richest provincial government subsidies at $7,000 per vehicle last year. This has contributed to Quebec’s status as the province with the most EVs, ahead of B.C. and Ontario in third place. But Quebec’s subsidies for fully electric vehicles will drop to $4,000 in 2025 before lowering to $2,000 by 2026 – with the program set to end in 2027. Virtually all subsidies for EVs in Canada are for new vehicles only — although B.C.’s SCRAP IT! program applies to used vehicles, and B.C. currently does not charge PST on used EVs. Recurrent EV Insights can help a buyer assess the health and remaining battery life of a used EV before making a purchase decision. The Seattle-based company provides a ""range score"" for an EV's battery, accounting for factors like temperature, age, charging habits and driving style (source: Recurrent) Aside from a detailed battery report, there are two more things to consider before you buy, said Andrew Garberson, head of growth and research at Recurrent, a Seattle-based platform providing consumers and car dealerships with information about used EV batteries. First, if you find a used EV you like enough to test drive, he suggests doing some simple battery math. If the console tells you, for example, that the car has 80 per cent charge left on the battery, and you know it has a certain range, make sure the battery reading accurately reflects that at the end of the test drive. If the battery reading drops down to 50 per cent after a 10-minute test drive, there’s a problem. His second piece of advice is to “understand that these batteries last much longer than most people expect.” In Canada, the minimum government-mandated warranty for battery electric drivetrains is eight years or 160,000 km, whichever comes first. “In all the research that we’ve done, less than two per cent of the cars have had a battery replaced, and we study cars that are up to 12 years old now,” Garberson said. “The manufacturers created warranties that would protect both the consumer and themselves. Nobody wants to have to pay for an expensive EV battery replacement or repair,” he added. A lot of used EV buyers right now are buying vehicles in the two-to-four year-old range, so they are well within warranty. Rick Jang and his Nissan Leaf (photo by Rick Jang) “I love this car” Not that everyone has anxiety about replacing an EV battery. Burnaby’s Rick Jang is a recently-retired heavy mechanic who spent his entire working life around emission-spewing ICE machines of every description. But in 2018, he bought a three-year old Nissan Leaf with 33,000 kms of mileage. After six years of driving 51,000 kms, he only has changed three wiper blades and the electrical coolant. His brakes are still at 80 per cent, and he said the gas savings have more than paid for the vehicle. A climate skeptic, Jang did not buy the vehicle to cut emissions: “I bought it because I didn’t want to pay $2 for a litre of gas.” His 10-year-old used EV can still get 150 km range, but the battery warranty is long past. Jang plans to eventually buy a Chinese battery pack and hire a dealer to install it at a cost of around $6,000 or maybe less by the time it happens.. “If my battery lasts another five years, I will order in a battery pack, because I love this car.”","the average price of a used battery electric vehicle (BEV) on autoTrader.ca fell to $42,398 in February, a 16.3% decline year-over-year decline . the impact of the Trump tariffs on North American supply chains could slow new autistic supply chains .","electric vehicle, vehicle bev, battery electric"

Tesla,"I'm a Tesla investor and I've got millions in the company. I think Elon Musk is key to Tesla's success, but it can endure without him.","Christopher Tsai is the president and chief investment officer of Tsai Capital.

A fifth of the firm's $137 million portfolio was in Tesla stock last month, and Tsai told BI he's buying more.

Tsai said Musk's ties to the Trump administration were a ""significantly positive event"" for Tesla.

For many investors, Tesla's fortunes are inextricably tied to its CEO, Elon Musk.

But Tsai Capital's Christopher Tsai says the EV giant could endure even if Musk were no longer at its helm.

""Elon is clearly a key piece of the story, but Steve Jobs was also a very key piece of the Apple story. Steve Jobs could do things that Tim Cook could not do, and Tim Cook does things that Steve Jobs couldn't do,"" Tsai told Business Insider.

""Just because a visionary might no longer be with the company doesn't necessarily mean we would exit,"" he added. ""We would need to look at the fundamentals and the situation at the time.""

Tesla figures prominently in Tsai's $137 million investment portfolio.

The 50-year-old is the president and chief investment officer of his namesake investment management firm. In an SEC filing on February 12, Tsai Capital said it owned 69,700 shares, or about one-fifth of its portfolio.

But Tsai Capital held even more Tesla shares as recently as August. In an SEC filing on August 13, Tsai Capital said it owned 131,300 shares of Tesla.

Tsai told BI he decided to scale down on his Tesla investments last year because it was becoming ""an outsized portion"" of his portfolio.

""We first invested in Tesla in February 2020, paying an average of $41.66 a share,"" Tsai said. ""Tesla has increased significantly since our initial investment.""

Tsai Capital, however, has started buying Tesla stock again, Tsai said. This is despite the turmoil and uncertainty plaguing the company in recent weeks.

Tesla shares have slid by more than 50% from their record highs. The company's shares closed at about $225 on Tuesday, down from a peak closing price of $479 in mid-December.

The automaker, which initially enjoyed a postelection boost after Donald Trump's November election victory, has seen its sales decline in Europe and China.

Musk's work with the White House DOGE office has also caused problems for Tesla. People protesting Musk have descended upon Tesla showrooms nationwide.

In an interview with The Guardian published Saturday, Tsai said he hoped Musk's DOGE run would be ""short-lived"" so Musk could focus on Tesla.

Tsai told BI that while Musk's work with DOGE weighed on Tesla, Musk's involvement with the US government was a ""significantly positive event"" for the car company.

""Elon being involved in the government is allowing him to shape policy,"" Tsai said, adding that he thought the ""negative market sentiment will disappear at some point.""

There's room for more than one player in the EV industry

Tsai said Tesla would not be displaced by the Chinese automaker BYD within the EV industry. CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images

Tesla has been facing increased competition from rivals like the Chinese automaker BYD.

In January, BYD said it sold 1.76 million battery electric vehicles in 2024, putting it close to the 1.79 million vehicles that Tesla sold in the same year.

Like Tesla, BYD is pursuing autonomous vehicles. Last month, BYD said it would give customers its self-driving software free. Tesla owners in China must pay about $8,800 to use the vehicles' self-driving features.

On Tuesday, Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD went up by as much as 6% after the company announced a charging system that it said could provide a nearly 250-mile range on a five-minute charge.

Tsai told BI he didn't think BYD would displace Tesla given the EV market's potential for growth.

""We're talking about almost a hundred million vehicles a year, and there's room for more than one player,"" Tsai continued, adding that Tesla would not be priced out by BYD.

""History shows that people will pay for something that is superior, even if there is a competing option that is free,"" Tsai said.

Musk and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Tsai attributed Tesla's declining sales to the refresh of the Model Y. The new Model Y launched in China in January and was made available for order in the US and Europe weeks later.

""When you stop selling vehicles because of a refresh, there will be a temporary slowdown in sales,"" Tsai said. ""These things don't go in straight lines.""

Tsai's bullishness on Tesla sets him apart from other investors like Ross Gerber, who told BI last week that he didn't expect Tesla's stock to rebound this year.

""We're long-term investors,"" Tsai said. ""We don't try to time the market. We focus on the fundamentals, and we think that Tesla's revenue and earnings will continue to grow substantially in the years to come.""","Christopher Tsai is the president and chief investment officer of Tsai Capital.

Tesla,Thousands of Tesla owners doxxed. The only way to get off the list? Sell your car,"Amid worldwide protests against Tesla due to CEO Elon Musk’s involvement in the company, a website has surfaced with address and contact information of thousands of Tesla owners. And the same site says that the only way to get off the list is to prove that you’ve sold your car.

Protests against Tesla started in February, with groups picketing outside stores across North America and elsewhere.

The protesters have been pretty clear in their reasoning why – they’re not fans of Elon Musk and his recent actions.

In case you’ve been under a rock, Musk has been meddling in politics recently, after being radicalized by his twitter feed which he is hopelessly addicted to. It started with a nine-figure bribe to a convicted felon’s presidential campaign, which many thought would produce results in the form of corruption after said felon wandered back into the Oval Office (despite that there exists a clear legal remedy for insurrectionists), and appointed Musk to a fake and redundant government department which has so far expectedly failed to produce any meaningful results.

This meddling is predictably not working out great so far for Tesla, the business which produced the vast majority of Musk’s wealth and which he is still, somehow, the titular leader of.

It turns out, people don’t particularly like it when you’re part of an administration that dedicates itself to poisoning Americans, raising their costs, and harming US industry, among all the other ill-considered actions going on at the federal level. The administration Musk is a part of is actively trying to make EVs more expensive and harder to charge, both of which will harm Tesla – and your air quality.

Even Elon Musk himself acknowledges that these actions are “not good for America or the world” – or at least he did, back before he forgot how climate change works.

The unambiguous Nazi salutes didn’t help either – which were not out of character for Musk, given his history of white supremacist statements and his current support for German neo-Nazis. He has since gone on to agree with a defense of Hitler’s actions in the Holocaust.

All of this has resulted in a huge drop in Tesla popularity, and along with that has come a drop in sales and the aforementioned protests, many of which are being exercised by Tesla owners and EV fans who are dismayed that the electric car company’s leadership has taken such an anti-EV turn.

There are passive protests like Tesla owners debadging their cars, and then the active ones like those who are exercising their First Amendment right to picket outside of Tesla stores.

Musk and the government he’s a part of have responded to these protests in their expected manner: by spreading misinformation with the intent of silencing the protesters’ free speech – a fundamental right which Musk has long shown disdain for.

And then, beyond that, there are… let’s say less accepted forms of protest happening in the US and elsewhere.

Today, we’re seeing a whole new type of protest – in the form of a hacker group which got access to Tesla account data and posted it all online, exposing thousands of Tesla owners’ information on the web.

Tesla owners’ information posted on protest site

The website includes a map and a snarky message stating the site’s intent – claiming that it’s a social media site for Tesla owners, rather than a protest site. But it also says that it encourages “creative expressions of protest that you can execute from the comfort of your own home.” Though, the site also uses a molotov cocktail as a cursor replacement.

Here is the text on the site (the name of the site has been redacted here, because while the information doesn’t seem particularly harmful on its own, given that most of it is public, I’d still rather not be responsible for leading people towards it):

Before you embark on any adventure, we highly recommend checking out the No Trace Project. I want my information removed. Absolutely! Just provide us with proof that you’ve sold your Tesla. Email XXXXX. We only accept scanned documents in JPG and PNG formats.

The way that the information was collected is not immediately apparent, nor does the group make any claims as to how it got the information. It may not have even come from Tesla itself, since it includes somewhat random pieces of information for each owner.

It seems to have been posted by an anarchist group, given the site’s linking to an anarchist website.

The information is categorized under different icons, with designations for Tesla stores, Superchargers, Tesla owners’ cars, and then additional people of interest – which seem to largely be known residences of staffers working at Elon Musk’s bungling government department.

A quick check of the information suggests that it is not complete – there are many Tesla owners who are not listed on the site. And most of the information seems to just be addresses, phone numbers, business names and the like – much of which is already public information. Though there are also some email addresses and social media handles associated with certain entries, which may not be public information.

Also, Tesla locations are listed – such as Superchargers and Tesla stores. These are wholly public information and can be found on Tesla’s website.

Further, some outlets have confirmed that some of the information is not accurate.

But, if any given Tesla owner is on the list, the site offers a remedy: merely email them with a scanned document proving you sold your car, and you will be removed. We haven’t tried this out to see if it will work or not, but if any owners do (note: you probably shouldn’t), feel free to reach out to us.

Electrek’s Take

We’ve said this time and time again, but Tesla owners, on the whole, are still normal people. It’s silly to suggest that each individual owner of one of the world’s most popular cars, some of whom purchased their cars long ago, or who were just looking for the best EV they could get for a reasonable price, is somehow at fault for Elon Musk’s social media addiction and subsequent decline into madness.

Heck, most of us at Electrek are Tesla owners ourselves, and you might have noticed lately that we don’t support what Musk is doing to harm EVs and the company he leads specifically.

Of course the anger against Musk right now is understandable and warranted. And especially so from EV fans, who on the whole are going to be disproportionately likely to support moves towards a greener planet, unlike what the administration Musk is part of has been getting up to. Plenty of Tesla owners are already selling their cars, or moving to other brands – and the top reason is because of Musk.

But, putting a target on the backs of individual owners – even if only implied, and even if nothing comes of this – isn’t a great move. We’d encourage everyone to keep the focus on Musk’s terrible leadership, the captive Tesla board that’s personally profiting while they let him destroy the brand, and the government full of incompetents who are raising your costs and bought-and-paid oil stooges who are dirtying your air, rather than random individuals.

Tesla,'Left is the party of violence & hate': Musk says as FBI investigates 'potential act of terrorism' after Tesla vehicles torched in Las Vegas,"Several Tesla vehicles were destroyed in Las Vegas after being set on fire at a service centre. The attack, marked by the word ""Resist"" sprayed in red, is being investigated by the FBI as a potential act of terrorism. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, condemned the attack as ""terrorism"" and criticised the left for promoting ""violence"" and ""hate.""

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department characterised the incident as a ""targeted attack"", highlighting the use of a firearm and Molotov cocktails by the perpetrator. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, but the situation could have escalated if the fire had reached the vehicles' batteries.

The attack is part of a disturbing trend of arson against Tesla vehicles, with similar incidents having occurred in Kansas City and South Carolina.

The attacks coincide with increasing criticism of Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration, particularly his push for federal worker layoffs. This has led to a boycott of Tesla by some critics, with individuals selling their cars and applying anti-Musk stickers, such as ""I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy.""

🚨🇺🇸FBI NOW PROBING TESLA ARSON AS TERRORISM



The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force is now investigating a firebomb attack on Tesla’s Las Vegas facility after a suspect torched cars with Molotov cocktails and fired into vehicles.

The financial repercussions for Tesla have been significant, with the company experiencing declining sales. Further adding to the company's woes, a doxing website called 'Dogequest' leaked personal information of Tesla owners, demanding proof of vehicle sale for removal of details.

Despite the controversies, Musk has found support from former President Donald Trump, who recently purchased a Tesla as a gesture of solidarity. Trump praised Musk as a ""great patriot"" amidst the backlash.

While Tesla vehicles have increasingly become targets of vandalism, Musk insists that the company has done nothing to deserve such ""evil attacks."" He has publicly lamented the violence, noting, ""This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong.""

As the FBI continues its investigation, the incidents underscore the heightened tensions surrounding Musk's political involvement and its impact on Tesla and its stakeholders.","Several Tesla vehicles were destroyed in Las Vegas after being set on fire at a service centre.

Tesla,Elon Musk is MIA as a CEO. He's not alone.,"Tesla's stock has spent the past few months on autopilot , barreling toward a crash. Protesters angry with CEO Elon Musk's politics are burning electric-vehicle charging stations and vandalizing Cybertrucks , leading some owners to offload the cars before they become the next targets. A JPMorgan analyst said last week that the precipitous drop of some 50% of Tesla's market cap was unprecedented in the auto industry . And instead of returning to the dusty Tesla floor where he used to sleep to inspire workers to ""give it their all,"" Musk is continuing to play Donald Trump's all-powerful ""first buddy"" in Washington.

Musk's role at the White House DOGE office has made Tesla investors want their CEO back. But he's far from the first chief executive to go AWOL.

Absent leadership ""is something of a silent epidemic in corporations,"" says Laura McHale, the managing director of the professional coaching firm Conduit Consultants Limited. It can take several forms, she says: from ""leader distance,"" where CEOs are physically OOO as they court investors or go on the panel circuit or communicate infrequently, to psychological neglect (lacking direction, not delegating, failing to give employees proper recognition). While absenteeism is quieter than headline-making destructive behaviors like bullying or abuse, McHale says it's more common — and can be just as harmful to company morale and productivity. ""And yet, it's almost never talked about.""

The scope of the issue is hard to measure in part because what modern CEOs do all day — Musk included — is somewhat of a mystery. Until about 50 years ago, a chief executive's time was largely trackable, as they spent most of their day closely overseeing their company's product. But as mergers and IPOs became more common and corporations became more global, the CEO's role shifted from an internal product leader to a public figure seeking to drive shareholder value on the world stage. Today, many top CEOs jump from executive positions at companies in different industries rather than working their way up and learning a company inside and out. As they focus on building their personal brand or even working with an eye on the company's future, they may lose sight of the day-to-day operations that build strong company cultures. A 2009 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics found that as CEOs become superstars as well known as the companies they run, they begin to underperform. The ""consequences of media-induced superstar status for shareholders are negative,"" the study concluded.

Even at smaller firms, leaders' attention can become easily diverted. At startups in particular, CEOs have to focus on raising money and pleasing investors, which often takes them away from their offices. This absenteeism can turn ""toxic,"" McHale says. ""It is very destructive for employees and systems. It minimizes the importance of social relationships with our leaders."" A 2015 Interact/Harris Poll of US workers found that most of the communication issues people had with their company leaders weren't about bullying or demeaning behavior, but about what their bosses weren't doing: whether not knowing employees' names or not giving clear directions or recognizing their achievements. A paper from 2010 found that ""laissez-faire"" leadership was more prevalent than other types of destructive leadership. And a recently updated paper found that companies whose CEOs worked remotely were more likely to underperform and have lower valuations.

Musk is far from the first CEO to try to wear the hat in two places: Steve Jobs ran Apple and Pixar simultaneously, and Jack Dorsey oversaw Twitter (now X) and Square (now Block). But Jobs was a largely hands-off manager at Pixar, delegating tasks to other execs. Twitter had always been difficult to monetize and effectively moderate, and Dorsey stepped down in 2021.

But much as there's no comparison for Tesla's plunge in value, Musk himself is incomparable. In addition to Tesla and X, Musk has on his plate Neuralink, The Boring Company, SpaceX, and xAI. He remains chief executive of Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI — that's in addition to posting on X at a dizzying pace and fathering 14 children. In 2022, when he added Twitter to his empire of influential businesses, some management experts speculated that he'd bitten off more than he could chew. Musk slashed staff by 80% and ran the hobbled blue bird alongside his other companies for several months before naming Linda Yaccarino as CEO. A radically new version of Twitter, renamed X, still worked, defying many predictions that it would break under the pressure. Amid his X takeover, Tesla's stock also plummeted from a high of $309 a share in September 2022 to a low of $103 in January 2023 — because of concerns around EV demand, rising inflation and interest rates, and Musk's distractions at Twitter. But Tesla stock roared back through the rest of 2023.

So when Musk began raiding the federal government's IT system in the name of cost cutting, many were slow to count him out. Perhaps he could bring the outsider energy needed to pare down bureaucracy and keep his companies humming at the same time. So far, DOGE has fired thousands of workers, canceled lifesaving aid, and produced all-around chaos . You can debate how well Musk's tactics are working to cut government waste, but it's undeniable now that DOGE and Musk's political involvement are eating away at his biggest cash cow.

When it comes to Tesla, Musk is the missing CEO who isn't really missing — he's everywhere else. He dominates headlines each day, his face appearing constantly in the press and his posts gaining eyeballs all over X. That's part of Tesla's problem. Owners and would-be buyers of the cars no longer can separate Musk's political ideology from the brand, and his brutal cost-cutting tactics have turned people off. But it's not just Musk's divided attention and political unpopularity affecting the once premiere EV company: Tesla is facing several roadblocks , including increased competition in the electric vehicle industry from Chinese manufacturers and uncertainty around the development of its fully autonomous self-driving software.

Jumping in and out of the daily grind of companies ""is especially problematic when you're a micro-manager,"" says David Yoffie, a professor of international business administration at Harvard Business School. We know that Musk ""likes to really get into the weeds and into the details,"" Yoffie notes. But there aren't enough hours in a day to micromanage a handful of companies — and that makes it harder to dive deep into the core issues of each. In January and February, Musk was reportedly sleeping on the floor of his DOGE office across the street from the White House, adapting his hardcore playbook from working at Tesla and Twitter to show his dedication at DOGE. Musk traveled with Trump to Mar-a-Lago for a donor dinner as recently as this weekend. Following the election, he spent so much time at Trump's Florida oasis that the president joked: ""Elon won't go home. I can't get rid of him.""

Sometimes CEOs go long periods without seeing their employees or they communicate sporadically over email with staff in a way that creates more separation between themselves and workers. ""Without a finger on the pulse of what's really going on in their organization, they start losing credibility because they often will helicopter in, blow things up a little bit, create a big kerfuffle,"" Lori Dernavich, an executive coach and leadership development advisor, says of absent CEOs.

With Musk, the absenteeism isn't so silent. One Tesla backer, Christopher Tsai, has said he hopes Musk's "" involvement with DOGE is short-lived so he can spend even more time on his businesses."" Ross Gerber, a Tesla shareholder, told Business Insider in February that he was concerned about the other ventures that were pulling Musk's attention away from Tesla . ""His 100% focus is on AI, and that's really a detriment to Tesla more than it's a plus for xAI and all the other businesses because he doesn't work at Tesla anymore,"" Gerber said. ""If he were putting all of his time into Full Self-Driving, I'd feel a lot more confident about Tesla.""

Some founders start companies with an entrepreneurial spirit but find themselves bored with the day-to-day tasks of a CEO. That's generally a time for them to transition to a chairman role — perhaps the way Dorsey did with Twitter when he was pushed out of his role as CEO in 2008 — but not all willingly bow out. As a result, ""their sporadic presence means that they become a bottleneck for the organization,"" Dernavich says. ""That bottleneck leads to resentment, poor decision-making, slower response times, and the culture gets affected. So much can start going haywire when that happens.""

Asked how he's running his businesses alongside the demands of DOGE, Musk recently told Fox Business in a rare interview that he was doing so ""with great difficulty ."" It was a bad week. An outage took X offline (Musk later blamed a ""massive cyberattack"" originating in Ukraine, which experts have cast doubt on), and a second SpaceX rocket exploded during a launch. Tesla lost $127 billion in market cap in one day. Trump just bought a Tesla with hopes of boosting the car's popularity. He'll have to buy quite a few more to make up for Tesla's losses. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

Musk could afford for his wealth to drop by $100 billion or more in support of his political opinions, and his other companies are doing just fine. But being one of the most powerful people in the world means your actions and views have an outsize effect on everyone, including customers, shareholders, and workers at Tesla. Musk may have the stamina to hold out. The others may not.

Hi, I'm Rob Dietz.



Jason Bradford

I'm Jason Bradford



Asher Miller

And I'm Asher Miller. Welcome to Crazy Town where shooting lasers at the moon reminds us of a simpler time.



Melody Allison

Hi, this is producer Melody Allison. Thanks for joining us in Crazy Town where Jason, Rob, and Asher tackle crazy-making topics like climate change, overshoot, runaway capitalism, and why we're all deluding ourselves. Here's a quick warning: sometimes this podcast uses swear words (Language!). Now on to the show.



Asher Miller

Okay, guys, before we get to the conversation we're gonna have today, can we just do a little like nostalgia tour? Would that be okay with you?



Jason Bradford

That's all I want to think about is the past.



Asher Miller

I want to take you back to the 80s.



Jason Bradford

Yes.



Rob Dietz

That's my decade.



Asher Miller

Mid to late 80s. Back in the days where I had like a real long mullet.



Jason Bradford

You were beautiful, I'm sure.



Asher Miller

It was a mane of hair. It was incredible.



Jason Bradford

It's still amazing.



Asher Miller

But, you know, bangs up top.



Rob Dietz

Yeah, did you wear leg warmers and a jean jacket?



Asher Miller

Yes, I did. And I would watch Victoria Principal Jazzercise videos.



Jason Bradford

Who did the Maniac video?



Asher Miller

Oh, I don't remember. Any case, but I'm glad you're bringing up music. This is what I wanted to get to because I was prepping the other day for an event that we're going to be doing on April 1.



Jason Bradford

Oh, I thought you were like, getting your beans and grains together, or something like that.



Asher Miller

No, no, not that kind of prepping. Prepping for this event. So I'm going to be hosting a conversation with Vanessa Andreotti and Dougald Hine. We'll be talking about navigating the end of modernity, right? And I was reflecting on that word modernity, and for some reason, you know what, came to my mind? You won't be able to get this ever.



Rob Dietz

No, no one can get inside your mind other than you. You're just gonna have to reveal it.



Asher Miller

The album Quadrophenia.



Rob Dietz

Yeah, The Who.



Asher Miller

Yeah.



Jason Bradford

I mean, I don't know it super well, but I'd recognize tons of songs, I'm sure, right away.



Rob Dietz

But just time out for a sec. You said you were going back to the 80s, I'm pretty sure that was pre 80s.



Asher Miller

No, I'm talking about me listening to it. Okay. I've gone through phases with music, right? So I had my little Who phase, and The Who, like some other bands, like to do these rock operas. So Quadrophenia was basically a rock opera. The whole album was like one story. In fact, they made it into movie later. Quadrophenia was basically about these guys, you know, these teenagers, and they were part of this group called the Mods, like mod for modern. And they liked to dress up in these, like fancy suits. They called them zoot suits. And they were right around on Vespas. For some reason, I don't know, that album came to mind, so I had to go down memory lane listen to it, which is a lot of fun. But it made me think of something I wanted to ask you guys. Which is, albums, you know, I used to listen to albums. I would get these albums. I would buy them. I would save up my money, and I'd go buy these albums. You know, in opening up the album, reading the liner notes, sitting there, listening to it, like repeatedly listening to albums over and over and over again, you know? My boys, the way they listen to music is, I don't even know if they've ever -- I'm sure they've listened to an album all the way through, but they don't experience music as an album, right? They just experience it as a sort of instantaneous thing on their phone, you know? So maybe think of elements of modernity that have actually already left us, right? They're extinct already. And I know vinyl is not totally extinct.



Jason Bradford

It's coming back.



Asher Miller

But that experience feels like it's largely extinct, you know? So curious what you guys, what piece of modernity of your previous life that's now gone would you say you miss?



Rob Dietz

That's a really interesting question. It's like modernity technology is evolving so fast that some of it's just already gone. Even though you would still classify it as being a modern thing. Well, I'm gonna stick on the music scene for a little bit. Not not specifically the music, but the way that that you tune your radio. So do you guys remember how car stereos used to have these mechanical buttons, and you would actually chunk it in, you would push it in, and the little dial would move to your presets. I just love that -- That was fancy. That was incredible -- tactile, mechanical feel of some old stuff. And in fact, I have this problem, right? Like, you know those sinks that you put your hands in, and they're, like motion sensors, or somehow they know your hand is there? Like they don't recognize me. I don't know. I don't think I put off a stong electrical field.



Asher Miller

You're a ghost, man.



Jason Bradford

Oh, I know what you're talking about. For washing your hands.



Rob Dietz

Another example would be all these push button things, like a microwave or a stove.



Asher Miller

Wait, those don't work for you either? They don't recognize you?



Rob Dietz

A lot of times they don't. So I'm just like, can I just get an old mechanical dial? They work so well.



Asher Miller

This is why you use an Easy Bake Oven, isn't it?



Rob Dietz

Yeah, yeah. I just eat everything raw. There's no point in trying to cook.



Asher Miller

There you go. What about you? Jason.



Jason Bradford

Well, okay. Since we're on food, on Easy Bake, Chuck E. Cheese pizza time theaters. Do you remember those? Now, there was one not far from my house in Cupertino, California. They experimented with this Chuck E. Cheese, a different business model. And it was the best because you paid one fee to get in, and all the video games were just open, and all the pizza was just laid out for you. So you just, you show up with like your 10 bucks, or whatever.



Asher Miller

You were there all day?



Jason Bradford

And you could have unlimited games, unlimited pizza, and unlimited, like, animatronic shows.



Rob Dietz

Unlimited brain rot when you're leaving.



Jason Bradford

As an 11-year-old, do you have any idea how great that was?



Asher Miller

So that was your version of TikTok, basically. It was the unlimited --



Jason Bradford

Yeah. Unbelieveable. I'd just go there for hours.



Asher Miller

Interesting. Well, thank you for going down memory lane.



Jason Bradford

Unlimited sodas, too.



Asher Miller

Of course they had sodas. Okay, well, thanks for going down memory lane with me. But I would want to have actually a more serious conversation about modernity, if we can. And I thought we should bring in somebody who's been thinking about this a lot more than I have, I would say, and that's our good friend, Tom Murphy. So what do you guys think about us seeing if Tom would would join us?



Rob Dietz

Yeah, we're gonna bring him in.



Jason Bradford

Let's go.



Rob Dietz

And I'm gonna introduce Tom, because he is our favorite astrophysicist.



Asher Miller

How many astrophysicists do even you know?



Rob Dietz

Everybody needs a favorite astrophysicist. Tom's a professor emeritus from the University of California, San Diego. I don't know that I can get this right, but he used to test general relativity by bouncing laser pulses off of these mirrors that were left on the moon by Apollo astronauts.



Asher Miller

All of these things are lies. I mean, there's so many things you just said didn't actually happen, but okay, I'll just pretend.



Rob Dietz

And I genuinely love hanging around Tom as a friend. Asher, you and I got to spend some time at his house, and Tom took us out kayaking.



Asher Miller

Yeah, that was fun.



Rob Dietz

And I think I was even paddling a kayak that Tom had built, which is incredible.



Asher Miller

Yeah, and you did drown or anything. It was amazing.



Rob Dietz

I don't know, Asher, you were probably doing some work, but Tom took me back to his workshop and showed me the project that he kind of does in his spare time, where he's the Co-inventor of this aircraft detector. So the idea is that telescopes are shooting lasers into the sky, and you don't want to hit an airplane that's passing by. You'd get a hole through the airplane? Yeah, just cut it right in half. So Tom's got this thing that he made. He's like soldering parts on a computer. I don't know. I can't even use the terminology right.



Asher Miller

We should talk about this because Elon Musk's DOGE will come around and just cancel that contract.



Rob Dietz

Right. But anyway, after spending time in that world, you know, what's really interesting is Tom's turn toward the limits to growth. So anyway, let's get you in here Tom and find out what's what.



Tom Murphy

Sure, just send me the link and I'll show up.



Jason Bradford

Oh my gosh. He's here.



Asher Miller

It's a miracle.



Jason Bradford

You happened to be free.



Rob Dietz

Thanks for joining us, Tom.



Tom Murphy

Sure.



Jason Bradford

So we want to throw this question that we've been asking ourselves: Extinct modernity, right? So I had Chuck E Cheese pizza time theater. Rob and Asher, I don't even remember their stuff. It was stupid. But anything that happened in the past that's now extinct that's part of modernity. What's your favorite?



Tom Murphy

Well, I really liked the discussion that you had. And you know, at first, I thought things like the space shuttle and the Concord represented a vision of where we thought we were going. And in fact, I put the space shuttle on the front of my textbook. And I didn't ever explicitly mention this, but in my mind is, where the hell does it think it's going? You know, it just sort of seemed like we all knew what was happening. I miss the the extinct threat of nuclear war.



Jason Bradford

I'm glad it's extinct. I didn't even know that.



Asher Miller

It's coming back, Tom. It's coming back.



Tom Murphy

I know, but didn't we have this period where that was just no longer on the radar.



Jason Bradford

Right. Ohhh. You miss when we thought it was extinct?



Rob Dietz

Yeah, I misinterpreted that too. I thought we got real dark there for a second.



Asher Miller

Like I love the duck and cover drills that we used to do.



Tom Murphy

Somewhat intentionally, you know, playing both sides there. But you know the radio button discussion, you know, still, when you design a GUI, which I've done a number of times, there's one choice for radio button. You know, because you can only select one of the boxes at a time, and that still harkens back to that mechanical, you know, push this thing and the dial actually zips to where you want it to go. And tha reminded me of, well, dialing is a thing that we still talk about on the phone. But there's no dial anymore, which is great, because, you know, if you had a number with a lot of eights and nines in it, you're waiting forever.



Rob Dietz

It was terrible.



Asher Miller

Yeah, your friends never called you.



Rob Dietz

This about the delayed gratification when you were making a 1-800 call to order whatever the album, Asher, that you were buying off a TV



Asher Miller

From Time Life.



Rob Dietz

You had to really want that album.



Tom Murphy

Zeros are the worst. And how many of our youth know? That zeros were terrible. So you know an area code, like 212, whoa. That was a special -- Yeah. So anyway, but it reminded me of observatories because I cut my teeth, in a sense, at Palomar Observatory on the 200 inch telescope, which is just a marvelous machine. It's really a piece of art. It's crafted. It's lovingly made. It was made during the depression years, and things slowed down a lot, but that meant that they took their time. Well, and they just did things differently in any case. And then you go to a telescope like the Keck telescope, you know, which I also worked at in Hawaii, which is a modern 10-meter telescope, and it just seems rickety. You know, the stair, just the stairs that you're walking on, the hand rail doesn't feel very substantial. It's all just sort of cutting corners. But the thing that reminded me of the Palomar was the radio button, because Palomar had this great thing called the Phantom. The Phantom was this mechanical analog to the telescope that was, you know, recognizably telescope shaped and it sat in a little sort of cabinet. And it mimicked the actions of the telescope. So, it moved as the telescope did, just mechanically through whatever moved the telescope, moved the Phantom. But the reason they had the Phantom was they needed to know where to point the dome. And the dome was -- Basically, the Phantom had two wires on either side of it. And if it touched one wire, it would say, ""Oh, we need to move the dome this way to keep it aligned. ""So, it was a very mechanical, ingenious solution. And, you know, since then, they've replaced it with barcode scanners. So, you know, they have barcodes all around the periphery and a little scanner so they always know where it is. And I don't know what the price accumulates to during a night as it beeps and, you know, adds up the items, but you know, I really missed that age when you had this really clever mechanical approach. And now it's replaced with more computerized things that can fail. And when they fail, it's hard. Like cars, also. I miss the car that I grew up, starting when I was 16 and started to drive, was a Chevy 1974, Chevy pickup truck, with a six-cylinder inline engine. And I am not exaggerating when I say that you could stand in the engine compartment with your feet on the ground next to the engine on either side, because you had that much room. And now you look at a car, and there are about 12 things in between you and the pavement. If you shot a laser, you know, you would hit 12 things. No matter where you go, it's just so completely packed, there's no standing in it. And there was just a simplicity. You could point to everything and say, ""That's what this does, that's what this does,"" and you could fix it. Now, when something breaks, it's kind of irreparable. Planned obsolescence. Yes. All in the name of efficiency.



Asher Miller

Well, so Tom I wanted to invite you into a conversation with us before we actually do this event that we're going to be hosting with Vanessa and Dougald because I know you've been on a bit of a journey around modernity and it's been interesting as someone who's been so steeped in it, I would say, to see you go through that journey a little bit. But before we get to that, maybe, I'd be curious how you define modernity, like if somebody asked you. Because I would think for a lot of people, they don't even know what we mean when we question it.



Tom Murphy

Yeah, at some level, I kind of like the ambiguity of the term, because it doesn't have baggage yet associated with it. And so, people are more willing to entertain the idea that modernity has a time limit, and that it's temporary. And there are a lot of things about modern life that people don't like and wouldn't mind seeing going. So, if you say civilization, people have a much greater attachment to that word, because it feels like the opposite is barbarism and violence, and that's a false kind of dichotomy. But the point is, modernity doesn't have that kind of emotional attachment, and so it can mean many things. It's obviously how we live today. It's our culture, it's fossil fuels, it's high energy, it's high material use, it's science, it's technology. And these things have been with us for, you know, centuries, but not millennia. But I would actually, in my mind, I extend modernity to, I mean, there are different ways to think of it, but it's also an attitude, it's an approach, it's a culture. And it's a culture of believing in mastery of we are the pinnacle species, the evolutionary end point, if you will. And this is all kind of a mythology, a cultural mythology, and I borrow heavily from Daniel Quinn's Ishmael here, where our mythology is that the world belongs to us, and you know, we were made to rule it and conquer it and master it. And once you have that attitude, which is pretty old -- that's older than modernity -- thousands of years.



Asher Miller

Yeah, that's older than modernity.



Tom Murphy

That is the central shift that paved the way for modernity because we just got better and better at enacting that attitude. But the attitude is thousands of years old, not millions like humans, or hundreds of thousands like Homo sapiens. And so, it's relatively new, and certainly in ecological evolutionary timescales, it's a flash. Even 10,000 years is a flash. So the agricultural revolution was one of conquering. It was one of control. It was deciding what should live and what should die, plants and animals. And it's all for us. It belongs to us -- Fences, animal enslavement, all kinds of things came with it. And then we just got better and better at it, and perfected the art of control. And science really helped that technology, really helped that fossil fuels, really accelerated it so, you know, but I don't see those elements as major turning points. The turning point was, I think, a much earlier one that really set the stage for modernity. And we've been that recognizable culture ever since. We don't identify culturally with, say, hunter gatherers, but we sure identify with a Mesopotamian. You know, we understand what they were after and how they approached the world. So that, to me is the big definer of modernity is, it's our attitude of how we comport ourselves on this planet.



Rob Dietz

So Tom, I don't want to like ascribe some attribute to you, but you know you're talking about the, you know, how we enacted this attitude of mastery and this art of control, but you were kind of ensconced in an arena that was really playing out that story, right? I mean, you're in an astrophysics department. You're doing things that are, you know, super, super high tech. I mean, honestly, I mean, I'm still, I find myself impressed, right? Like, I'm like, wow, you built this thing. Or, you know, how do you know how to do that? You know, I remember asking you that in your workshop. And you just talked about tinkering a lot with things as a kid, and just being really interested in it. Being steeped and at a place like that, in the university system, and kind of being in that culture in a big way, how did you get out of that? What's the journey to, you know, to saying the kinds of things that you just said, where you're recognizing this human supremacy in this culture that maybe won't work. One does not logically follow the other. So I'm curious, how did you get there?



Tom Murphy

I mean, I was definitely fully invested. I mean, I was all in as a member of modernity, doing exactly what you would hope a member of modernity would do. You know, shooting lasers at the moon. That's everybody's dream, right? So I think the way I see the journey is that I was always interested in understanding the path that we're on and trying to imagine where things are going. I grew up with Star Trek in the next generation as a teenager, and really loved it. And I think, you know, I never liked the original Star Trek because it just seemed too campy and nerdy. And I was not a real nerd kid. I only learned to do that later. But I really liked Spock because my family was so illogical. The guy was a beacon of logic, and so I really aspired to have that mental discipline and so forth. And so I think that was really influential. And I really loved the sort of fantasy world of, you know, the prime directive and all this, you know, enlightened future that we could embrace. And, you know, this was our path. And I was not questioning that really. It was exciting. The space shuttle was exciting. Here's, you know, our path into the stars and so forth. But, you know, as a kid, and now I associate those ideas with juvenile fantasy, right? And it's almost surprising to me to see the other people who have become adults and are still, you know, still there.



Asher Miller

Including the richest among us.



Tom Murphy

Absoletely. I mean, the biggest blind spot you can imagine. So, I think I was always interested in the future, and so I knew that energy was an important part of how we get things done. I mean, as a physicist, I clearly understood energy, and sort of physics owns energy, to some extent. And so, I was interested in teaching a course my first year at UC San Diego on energy in the environment. It's a general education course for non-science majors. And I thought, I'll pick this one. You know, I had a menu of what courses would you like to teach, and so nobody had claimed that one. And then I thought I would learn a lot. And I did. You know, I already knew that solar was so abundant that it's almost a no brainer that, of course, we'd just switch to solar when fossil fuels go away and it helps the CO2 problem and everything. So, you know, done, right? A simple premise and a simplistic, stripped down, decontextualized world has very simple solutions. And so it just seemed pretty obvious. But the more I looked into it, the more I realized it's hard. And I did my own solar setup. And I started small with one panel and a battery and a charge controller. And then I said, what about this other kind of panel, and this other kind of battery, and this other kind of charge controller, and let me just sort of get my feel for this. And I put just my television on it at first, and then I got another panel and another battery and put the living room lights on it. And then I thought, you know what'd be really cool is to run my refrigerator off of this. So more panels and more battery, and, you know. And it basically was an off grid system. And I was in a condo at the time, and, you know, had the landlord's permission to put a hole through the wall for an extension cord. And so I was just really kind of crude, but I learned so much, and the energy became very personal because I worked so hard to get it. And so watching TV, and I learned this was back in, you know, in a cathode ray tube, and it turns out that the darker the movie, the less energy it takes. Because you're lighting up the electron beam les. And that's not true now with, you know, LCD TVs where you have a backlight that's just full on, and then you have things to suppress the light coming through, but there's some variance on that. But still, I learned so much about living with your own energy, and the difficulties of off grid storage, intermittent power supplies, what do storms mean, what do, you know, periods of bad weather mean? But my approach was, let's technology our way out of this. You know, we're smart and clever people, and this is what we do. But the more I looked into it, the more I realized how much of a kind of House of Cards this whole business was and how there were some glaring weak spots. You know, growth itself is just a non-starter for long term success. But even at steady state, you can't maintain a steady state at billions of humans living a modern lifestyle. It's just a temporary stunt. So yeah, the more I realized -- And it's sort of came to closing exits, one after the other, where I just always assumed that we would figure it out. And now I've gotten to the point where I realize how naive that vision is because, you know, we construct mental models in our brains that -- Our brains are limited, by the way. I mean, they're organs. They're evolved to do certain things, and they do certain things pretty well, and they give us flexibility, but they're limited. They have, you know, only so much capacity, and something like an evolved ecology is so complicated and so many interconnections and dependencies and relationships that we barely scratch the surface of understanding. Our brains are just incapable of the kind of wisdom that an ecology expresses that's formed over deep time. And we're just simply incapable. And I think of it kind of like the ravenous bug bladder beast from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide. That's so stupid that if you to evade it, all you have to do is cover your eyes, because it figures if you can't see it, it can't see you, right? But we're almost as bad as that. Because if an ecology can't see its way into our brain, we assume it doesn't exist. And there are a lot of things that don't fit into our brains, into our mental models. Most things don't. And so we have this bias toward our models, toward the map and not the territory, so that we assume if it doesn't fit in our brain, it might as well not exist. And you'll see this all the time with, I don't see why not, is a common response to why we won't go to Mars, or why we won't keep modernity going forever. I don't see why not. It's like, yes, that's precisely the problem, you know, but thanks for admitting it. That's very big of you and an important step to realize that you don't see why not, and that's okay. We're not expected to see everything.



Asher Miller

I think you're right that that is actually progress for someone to say, ""I don't see why not."" Because a lot of what we see, we had a conversation not too long ago talking about this series of articles that the New York Times published on the future of the food system. And one of the things we talked about was that you start from these assumptions of how things must be, and then you try to figure out how those assumptions are going to get fulfilled, right? So, the assumption is people are going to continue to want to live in the desert. We're going to still need to consume the food the way that we do. It's like, of course, more people in the future are going to be consuming more energy. Like, that's just obvious. And so we just have to figure out how to how to solve that problem, versus questioning whether or not that assumption is even true in the first place.



Tom Murphy

Right. Yeah. I mean, the world doesn't bend itself to our will, which is why we've thought we had to conquer, you know, when the pests come in to eat our row crops. We have to, you know, how dare they? That's ours. We have to do something about it. And so, yeah, the universe is really not on board with just making sure that our schemes work. And you know, it's going to fight back.



Jason Bradford

One of the things that I have trouble with continually is knowing all this and then still living in modernity and wondering, you know, is there a way where I can start practicing or trialing post modernity ways of life.And it becomes really hard to do. I often joke that I'm sorry I didn't grow up as a Romanian peasant because I was spending time with Chuck E Cheese pizza time theater instead of, you know, learning how to do all the things that someone as a kid would just normally get up and do. And so, when you see people from these other cultures, and I know Rob has a fan, he's like watching some of these YouTubes of these people that like, know how to live out in nature and have these incredible skill sets. And what do I do? I teach tennis. I teach kids how to hit a fuzzy yellow ball with a graphene racket and and poly strings on a concrete court with painted lines. I love doing it. It's a lot of fun. But I almost wish, like, could these parents pay me to teach their kids to do something else? But it's not just not part of our culture, right? It's like, it's easy money to teach people how to play tennis, but if you say, I'm going to try to teach us and learn how to live without all the trappings of modernity. You know, it's just like, good luck. That's not much of a viable business, I don't think. Or maybe it is. Maybe I should try that. But I don't think I'd get very much interest, honestly. So what do you do? What do you do? Like, you know, as somebody who grew up in all this and knows the BS, but you don't have the skill set, and the vast majority of people around you aren't even interested.



Tom Murphy

Yeah, I think I look at the longer game here, because I don't think I am personally going to exit modernity. I mean, I'm steeped in it. It's all I know. I don't have the skill sets, or, most importantly, the community, because it's not an individualistic approach. We're not the rugged individuals we pretend to be. We're a species that's, you know, contextualized to group survival and working cooperatively within that fairly small band. So that's very unlikely to ever be my reality. And I don't stress about it too much. I don't think that by next week I have to be out. You know, it's not going to happen, and modernity took a while to build. It's not going to necessarily take 10,000 years that it took to get to this point to unwind, but it can take generations. And it will take generations. I mean, some things will go away fast, and then some things will, you know, cling for for maybe centuries, recognizable elements of modernity. And each child that's born into the conditions that exist at that time will just accept those conditions as normal and get on with life. We're very plastic and adaptable, not necessarily as individuals, but as a species because we're just sort of almost blank slates, but with some decent instincts that are honed by evolution to work together, to be cooperative, to be observant, to be creative in how we adapt to a changing situation. And so that's, I think, going to be the story. And the people listening to this don't have to stress about not getting it right and propagating this machine. But the thing that I try to do most is just, I'm no longer in love with modernity, and talk of it as an abusive partner that said nice things to me occasionally and brought me flowers, but really, you know, at the cost of a sixth mass extinction. And so, there's kind of this dark side to it that I shouldn't really embrace. And so, I just don't care to propagate all of those trappings. And I can dial it down. I don't have to stop it, but I can be part of the off ramp by just sort of not playing the game the same way, not being a consumer, not supporting fantasies politically.



Jason Bradford

The problem is, it's hard not to be a consumer. I mean, Asher gets pissed off every time he's like, ""Oh God, I've gotta order something from Amazon."" And he's just mad. He's just mad because he's like, I don't have another -- What choice do I have? And I kind of feel like, every once in a while, my family says, ""Can you please go pick something up at Safeway?"" And I'm just like, ""Argh."" And then they know, like, I'm gonna break out in hives when I walk in and see the mylar balloons, you know, right in the front because of whatever holiday is coming up, and the stacks of soda cans. So it jars me. Like you're saying, it's like, you know, oh, do I have to go back into this abusive relationship here and just dip my toe in it continually. And that's kind of what it feels like. Because I sort of see through what it took to fill this store up with, you know, all this junk, all this cargo, and I'm mad sometimes because I feel like everybody around me is in this cargo cult, and I don't want to be there all the time. So I guess, you know, you find your ways to sort of stay out as much as you can, is what you're saying, even though you you can't help it a little bit. Because, like you say, we're really a social species, and so without -- Like I said, if I had 50 kids that wanted to learn something besides tennis, but I don't. So what do I do? Right?



Tom Murphy

Yeah, well, I know what you do, Jason. I know you go look at birds.



Jason Bradford

Yeah, I do, yeah.



Tom Murphy

Yeah, exactly. And that's fantastic, because they don't care about tennis, and they don't care about what's in Safeway, yeah. And if you ask them about what's going on in, you know, Trump world right now, they don't care. And there's a wisdom there. And I'm not being flippant about the word wisdom here because a wisdom that took millions upon millions of years to establish itself and establish itself as survivable, as you know, a presence, has gotten a lot of things right. And the fact that the birds, and I see newts around my place and love them to bits, and I really take a lesson from the fact that they're just living by the laws of life. So what we've done is we've created an artificial world out of our brains. And I think of modernity as a big brain fart. You know? And I might be a little hesitant to use such foul language on any other podcast, but you guys, you know, I've listened to your show. So yeah. I mean, it's just this concoction, this fabrication that's not grounded and doesn't have the same kind of wisdom. It's just sort of a look what I can do stunt. No hands. Wow, look at that. The animals and the plants don't go in for all that, and they're better for it. And so we ought to actually take something from that and realize that we can't just make it all up on our heads and expect it to work.



Rob Dietz

Jason, you would be one of those bowerbirds that is pulling mylar balloons and plastic spoons and other stuff to build your nest.



Jason Bradford

I sometimes wish I was a bird because then I could just fly around and I could land in that tree, and I could take my little beak into the lichen and moss and find little bugs and, you know, make a little nest and yeah. You know, they just know how to live in that forest or whatever, or stick their bill in the ground and pick out things. I can't even see what they're eating. I know they're finding food. You know, who does that around here are the orioles when they make their nest. It really bums me out.



Asher Miller

Well, they're just, you know, they're, working with what's in the environment. Yeah, the thing that I appreciate what you said Tom just about not beating yourself up for participating in modernity, but also maybe practicing some sort of detachment, I guess a little bit. I feel batted back and forth between feeling trapped, frankly, in the reality that we currently live in, when I know, to the degree that I do the consequences of it. will you end already? You know, like I have sometimes this sort of this impatience though. I don't want it to end, and certainly not end badly or quickly. I also, I think there are moments where I deeply appreciate the benefits we've had from modernity and like wanting to appreciate it as much as I possibly can if I recognize that it's fleeting.



Jason Bradford

Like Quadrophenia.



Asher Miller

No, like we're able to have this conversation and not be in the same room together. It would be much more lovely, frankly, to be in a room together. But I am fortunate in my work to have conversations on a weekly basis with people all around the world that I would have never gone to meet or learn from. That's an absolute gift of modernity. So . . .



Rob Dietz

Yeah, or when you have a tooth problem, you go to a dentist. You don't have to, like, knock it out with a rock, you know? That's a pretty sweet deal in modernity.



Asher Miller

That's true. But the other thing that I really struggle with is the fact that we're actually on an acceleration path with modernity still, or at least the technological elements of modernity.



Jason Bradford

Yeah, AI stuff.



Asher Miller

And in fact, I feel like the people, you mentioned that maybe modernity as a concept is more it's less loaded for people as something to question than something like civilization, right? Because that feels more threatening to them. And I see that. I think people are increasingly feeling the ill effects of how modernity manifests itself in their lives now. I mean, you look at, we talked about the food system earlier, you look at just the deeply unhealthy nature of the modern food system and what it's doing to people's bodies, I think. But also communications technology, the internet, social media, these kinds of things. I think that might actually be the fact that it's accelerating so much, and it's so ubiquitous, and it's sort of conquered us on some level. That might be the actual thing that has people be more receptive to a message of modernity coming to an end. They may not recognize that it's going to come to an end, whether we fucking like it or not. But, they may be more open to thinking about it ending because they're seeing that it's not benefiting them as much. I don't know.



Tom Murphy

Yeah, I do think a lot of people are aware that things aren't quite right, and that things are maybe going a bit sideways, and the dream is not being fulfilled. I believe that, you know, 75 years ago, it was fairly widespread sense that we're aiming for, you know, ever better world. We're going to craft it. We finally have the tools to craft it the way we want. We have the energy and the power, and it hasn't gone so well. And it's also, by the way, initiating a sixth mass extinction, which is pretty serious, because a heavy primate that is high maintenance and, you know, hungry, is not going to fare well in a six mass extinction scenario. Short of that, you said that like it or not, modernity is going to end. And that's absolutely true. And even just from a materials point of view. I mean, you know, we've taken the low hanging fruit in just a few centuries, and most of it in the last 50 years. I mean, the pace is extreme. And so, you can't really keep this pace up for even 1,000 years, 10,000 years. So modernity will starve itself of metals on that time frame. And the other thing that I recognize is that, you know, the materials that we use in modernity are not of this ecological world. We dig them out of the ground, and they're not part of the circulation in the community of life that we use. In fact, 96% of our mass comes from air and water, reconstituted, reorganized. But the, you know, the oxygen, the carbon, the hydrogen, the nitrogen, is all from air and water. And then only 4%, you know, a lot of calcium, phosphorus --



Jason Bradford

Potassium.



Tom Murphy

Potassium, yeah, are in common circulation in community of life. But not copper, not magnesium. Well, little, tiny bit of magnesium. But, you know, titanium.



Asher Miller

Well, you know, trying to put that into our bodies as much as possible, Tom.



Tom Murphy

Yeah, exactly. Yeah, aluminum, you know, these are weird, exotic things that we're spewing. You know, maybe not intentionally, maybe not, you know, immediately, but if it comes out of the ground, it ends up in the environment, You know, on the Millennium timescale that's just out there. And the community of life doesn't know what to do with it. And sometimes it's innocuous, but more often than not, it actually causes problems. And so not only are we going to starve ourselves of these metals if we tried to continue modernity, but it's contributing that their use and dispersal contribute to sickness and ailing in the physical world, biophysical world. So yeah, we don't really have a choice to continue it. It's not a long-term viable mode of living on this planet. I think you know in terms of giving it up or letting it go, a little bit of detachment goes a long way. That's something that can be a little bit contagious in the sense that we take cues from each other in our culture, and we're a social species. And so, if a number of us react to this sense that things aren't going according to the dream, and that the dream was never realistic, maybe more detachment among more people will have pretty serious consequences and will kind of get out in front. All the video, you know, TikTok and whatever is part of the phenomenon that detaches us from ourselves, and that is having consequences in terms of fertility. And so we're going to see this big demographic shift in this second half, or maybe even the first half of the century. We'll see possibly a peak of global population, and it's going to be big news. And how we react to that is going to be fascinating. I mean, some people are saying we just need to make more babies. Elon Musk is on like, is on the job, man. He's trying to make as many babies as he can right now. That's right. And, you know, JD Vance, similar. I mean, a lot of these folks are like, we need to become baby factories. But I don't think it's gonna work, and so But then some people will embrace it and say, ""You know what? This is actually -- maybe we can make this into a good thing."" And so that's kind of where I am on it.



Rob Dietz

So Tom, I really appreciate the way you framed the idea that modernity is a temporary stunt. You know, it's like a Red Bull mountain biker coming down a cliff, doing a double back flip without touching the handlebars, or whatever. You know, it's like, ""Wow, look what we can do.""



Tom Murphy

Or the show ""Jackass"" comes to mind.



Rob Dietz

Well especially when I'm talking it does. I actually can't believe that I'm not talking about the other thing. You called it a big brain fart. That's more up my alley, but anyway, this this idea of a temporary stunt, and then falling out of love with temporary stunts like, you know, eventually kind of saying, yeah that's fine that I could do that, but did I really need to, you know, and at what cost? And so, you know, I've heard your recommendation is try to detach yourself from that. But what I'm wondering that maybe you could share with listeners is, how do you talk to other people about that? Do you just tell them about your experience and what's happened with you to kind of start what you called a contagious detachment. Like, how? How do you, you know, let's say you're wandering around the physics department at your university, and people are like, this is not on their radar whatsoever. I mean, how would somebody out there broach the topic and start to make some headway? You know, what does Jason tell his tennis students, you know, that gets them on a path towards wanting to be birds as well?



Tom Murphy

So I was reminded of a, and by the way, before I forget this one, you talked about, you know, being enamored of the stunt and falling out of love with the stunt, but you also prefer brain fart. So you need to fall out of love with the smell of your own brain fart. I mean, people like their own brand sometimes, but you just -- That's disgusting. So yeah, I was reminded of the secret handshake kind of thing where I had a friend who moved to Utah. It was a couple who moved to Utah. And he was describing, you know, it's Mormon country, and he's not Mormon, but he was saying that when you plan some event with somebody who you barely know, you're just trying to get to know people, and you're trying to find a time when you can do something. You're like, well, Saturday, I'm doing something, but what about Sunday? And you just totally float out there because if they're Mormon then absolutely not. And if they're like, ""Yes, Sunday would work,"" You're like, ""Great, let's be friends."" You know? It's like, you like cream soda? I like cream soda too. We'll be best friends. So, um, yeah, it is kind of like that.



Asher Miller

So we need certain like secret words or secret signals to the other modernity questioning people.



Tom Murphy

Yeah. because I would have my ears out and, you know, listen for any hints from other people. And I would drop some hints, you know, about how I think about things. And occasionally you'd run into somebody who catches the hint, and then you start talking. But it's not something that I could walk up to anybody in my department and just sort of have an interesting, fruitful discussion about modernity and its temporary nature. And same among my friends. I mean, I've got a lot of really good friends who basically just don't want to talk about this stuff and d I don't push it, you know, because I want to stay friends. And I had a friend that came from, you know, that I hadn't seen in 30 years. A college roommate who came and stayed with me and his wife, and, you know, it was great fun to catch up. And I might have dropped a few little hints of where I am now, but I didn't really want to burden that fun experience with, oh, by the way, here's why I think this is all going, you know, south. So I don't know. It is a bit isolating. AnI was thinking about that Asher, when you were talking about how you're able to connect with people internationally. But I think when you're in such a rarefied place of having this view, you kind of need that community, and you need to go far and wide to find it.



Asher Miller

That's true, yeah.



Tom Murphy

Because, you know, you can't just go to your next door neighbor and expect to connect over this kind of issue.



Rob Dietz

When they complain like traffic's bad, you can't go, Yeah, and civilization is collapsing. It doesn't really work, does it?



Asher Miller

Well you can if you want to end conversations quickly, which is what I like to do sometimes, you know, because I'm an introvert and I don't like people. I think it's a good recommendation, maybe for our listeners, who obviously -- The ones who bother to listen to more than one episode I think are folks who kind of are inhabiting the same sort of space as us, and maybe this is a secret handshake kind of community that they're also part of. So, what I'm taking away is not riddling ourselves with guilt, not expecting ourselves to completely detach, but to maybe detach a bit emotionally or in terms of our identity to what is modernity now. And then, maybe, you know, dropping little seeds every once in a while in interactions with people that maybe some people pick up and ask a question about it. You know, I think even just naming things as not being permanent can be useful.



Tom Murphy

Well, and we make decisions all the time that might have some long-term ramifications, like. Like, you know, the road that I live on is private road, and it's in fine shape. It was paved, you know, probably 30 years ago. And it's okay. It's a light use road, but at some point it'll need resurfacing. And it makes sense to resurface it if modernity is just continuing for a long time, but a lot of things don't make sense anymore if it's just a temporary stunt. And that's what part of the falling out of love is about. It is in the detachment. It is recognizing that, wait, why am I doing this thing if our future doesn't look like what we were all told our future was going to look like. What does it really mean, and why am I doing this? And so that that's a big part of it is always asking yourself, why am I doing this in the context that this is temporary.



Rob Dietz

Yeah, I guess a takeaway I'll throw out there is that falling out of love with modernity just opens up more space to fall more deeply in love with the complexity of the ecosystems that you inhabit.



Tom Murphy

You bet.



Rob Dietz

I try really hard to be observant of what's going on in the places that I inhabit. And observant of the things nature is doing, not observant of all the hubbub of modernity. And it's hard to do, but I think the more you can focus on that, the healthier you are, and the more in the future you'll be able to make decisions like, yeah, let's not resurface this. Let's let it return to a path and eventually to a forest, or whatever it's going to be.



Asher Miller

I appreciate you coming and sharing this with us, Tom. Just a little bit about your journey and the way that you think of it. I think it's inspiring and hopeful for me to know someone who I would say, you could have been very well excused to have stayed embedded in modernity, you know, considering the work that you're doing, what you studied, and all that. And for you to not only step out of it and question it, but I think in what you do at Do the Math, your blog.



Tom Murphy

Which you started by the way. You realize that?



Asher Miller

Yeah, no, we talked about that. You did it, nan, that's all you.



Tom Murphy

No, but that's part of the journey. And I forgot to mention it. Is that you're an important part of that in encouraging me to put these ideas out.



Asher Miller

We've heard from a lot of people who have been following your writings, and I think it's helped them on their journey. So anyways, I hope that folks listening maybe want to join the conversation that we're going to have with Vanessa and Dougald, who also have been thinking very deeply about this, and just naming something that every one of us has tended to take for granted as an absolute. Just naming it as sort of the emperor s clothes thing, you know, is an important first step. So maybe we'll see you in person soon and we can go back out on those kayaks. Yeah, I'd love to have you come up here, or, you know, I want to go down your way sometime soon. And Jason will have you harvesting potatoes.



Tom Murphy

Sounds like he's going to have me working on my forehand.



Jason Bradford

Yeah, that too. We can do both.



Asher Miller

With potatoes. You could be hitting the potatoes with the racket.



Jason Bradford

I could show you the local newt pond we have here, you know, so They're probably mating right now if you want to come by.



Tom Murphy

Yeah, actually here they're heading to the mating zone. I see them heading north to their little mating pond.



Rob Dietz

Alright you guys, leave the newts alone to do their thing.



Asher Miller

Alright thanks guys.



Jason Bradford

Alright. Good seeing you, Tom.

Thanks again for listening and sharing.

","Rob Dietz Hi, I'm Rob Dietz. Jason Bradford I'm Jason Bradford Asher Miller And I'm Asher Miller. Welcome to Crazy Town where shooting lasers at the moon reminds us of a simpler time. Melody Allison Hi, this is producer Melody Allison. Thanks for joining us in Crazy Town where Jason, Rob, and Asher tackle crazy-making topics like climate change, overshoot, runaway capitalism, and why we're all deluding ourselves. Here's a quick warning: sometimes this podcast uses swear words (Language!). Now on to the show. Asher Miller Okay, guys, before we get to the conversation we're gonna have today, can we just do a little like nostalgia tour? Would that be okay with you? Jason Bradford That's all I want to think about is the past. Asher Miller I want to take you back to the 80s. Jason Bradford Yes. Rob Dietz That's my decade. Asher Miller Mid to late 80s. Back in the days where I had like a real long mullet. Jason Bradford You were beautiful, I'm sure. Asher Miller It was a mane of hair. It was incredible. Jason Bradford It's still amazing. Asher Miller But, you know, bangs up top. Rob Dietz Yeah, did you wear leg warmers and a jean jacket? Asher Miller Yes, I did. And I would watch Victoria Principal Jazzercise videos. Jason Bradford Who did the Maniac video? Asher Miller Oh, I don't remember. Any case, but I'm glad you're bringing up music. This is what I wanted to get to because I was prepping the other day for an event that we're going to be doing on April 1. Jason Bradford Oh, I thought you were like, getting your beans and grains together, or something like that. Asher Miller No, no, not that kind of prepping. Prepping for this event. So I'm going to be hosting a conversation with Vanessa Andreotti and Dougald Hine. We'll be talking about navigating the end of modernity, right? And I was reflecting on that word modernity, and for some reason, you know what, came to my mind? You won't be able to get this ever. Rob Dietz No, no one can get inside your mind other than you. You're just gonna have to reveal it. Asher Miller The album Quadrophenia. Rob Dietz Yeah, The Who. Asher Miller Yeah. Jason Bradford I mean, I don't know it super well, but I'd recognize tons of songs, I'm sure, right away. Rob Dietz But just time out for a sec. You said you were going back to the 80s, I'm pretty sure that was pre 80s. Asher Miller No, I'm talking about me listening to it. Okay. I've gone through phases with music, right? So I had my little Who phase, and The Who, like some other bands, like to do these rock operas. So Quadrophenia was basically a rock opera. The whole album was like one story. In fact, they made it into movie later. Quadrophenia was basically about these guys, you know, these teenagers, and they were part of this group called the Mods, like mod for modern. And they liked to dress up in these, like fancy suits. They called them zoot suits. And they were right around on Vespas. For some reason, I don't know, that album came to mind, so I had to go down memory lane listen to it, which is a lot of fun. But it made me think of something I wanted to ask you guys. Which is, albums, you know, I used to listen to albums. I would get these albums. I would buy them. I would save up my money, and I'd go buy these albums. You know, in opening up the album, reading the liner notes, sitting there, listening to it, like repeatedly listening to albums over and over and over again, you know? My boys, the way they listen to music is, I don't even know if they've ever -- I'm sure they've listened to an album all the way through, but they don't experience music as an album, right? They just experience it as a sort of instantaneous thing on their phone, you know? So maybe think of elements of modernity that have actually already left us, right? They're extinct already. And I know vinyl is not totally extinct. Jason Bradford It's coming back. Asher Miller But that experience feels like it's largely extinct, you know? So curious what you guys, what piece of modernity of your previous life that's now gone would you say you miss? Rob Dietz That's a really interesting question. It's like modernity technology is evolving so fast that some of it's just already gone. Even though you would still classify it as being a modern thing. Well, I'm gonna stick on the music scene for a little bit. Not not specifically the music, but the way that that you tune your radio. So do you guys remember how car stereos used to have these mechanical buttons, and you would actually chunk it in, you would push it in, and the little dial would move to your presets. I just love that -- That was fancy. That was incredible -- tactile, mechanical feel of some old stuff. And in fact, I have this problem, right? Like, you know those sinks that you put your hands in, and they're, like motion sensors, or somehow they know your hand is there? Like they don't recognize me. I don't know. I don't think I put off a stong electrical field. Asher Miller You're a ghost, man. Jason Bradford Oh, I know what you're talking about. For washing your hands. Rob Dietz Another example would be all these push button things, like a microwave or a stove. Asher Miller Wait, those don't work for you either? They don't recognize you? Rob Dietz A lot of times they don't. So I'm just like, can I just get an old mechanical dial? They work so well. Asher Miller This is why you use an Easy Bake Oven, isn't it? Rob Dietz Yeah, yeah. I just eat everything raw. There's no point in trying to cook. Asher Miller There you go. What about you? Jason. Jason Bradford Well, okay. Since we're on food, on Easy Bake, Chuck E. Cheese pizza time theaters. Do you remember those? Now, there was one not far from my house in Cupertino, California. They experimented with this Chuck E. Cheese, a different business model. And it was the best because you paid one fee to get in, and all the video games were just open, and all the pizza was just laid out for you. So you just, you show up with like your 10 bucks, or whatever. Asher Miller You were there all day? Jason Bradford And you could have unlimited games, unlimited pizza, and unlimited, like, animatronic shows. Rob Dietz Unlimited brain rot when you're leaving. Jason Bradford As an 11-year-old, do you have any idea how great that was? Asher Miller So that was your version of TikTok, basically. It was the unlimited -- Jason Bradford Yeah. Unbelieveable. I'd just go there for hours. Asher Miller Interesting. Well, thank you for going down memory lane. Jason Bradford Unlimited sodas, too. Asher Miller Of course they had sodas. Okay, well, thanks for going down memory lane with me. But I would want to have actually a more serious conversation about modernity, if we can. And I thought we should bring in somebody who's been thinking about this a lot more than I have, I would say, and that's our good friend, Tom Murphy. So what do you guys think about us seeing if Tom would would join us? Rob Dietz Yeah, we're gonna bring him in. Jason Bradford Let's go. Rob Dietz And I'm gonna introduce Tom, because he is our favorite astrophysicist. Asher Miller How many astrophysicists do even you know? Rob Dietz Everybody needs a favorite astrophysicist. Tom's a professor emeritus from the University of California, San Diego. I don't know that I can get this right, but he used to test general relativity by bouncing laser pulses off of these mirrors that were left on the moon by Apollo astronauts. Asher Miller All of these things are lies. I mean, there's so many things you just said didn't actually happen, but okay, I'll just pretend. Rob Dietz And I genuinely love hanging around Tom as a friend. Asher, you and I got to spend some time at his house, and Tom took us out kayaking. Asher Miller Yeah, that was fun. Rob Dietz And I think I was even paddling a kayak that Tom had built, which is incredible. Asher Miller Yeah, and you did drown or anything. It was amazing. Rob Dietz I don't know, Asher, you were probably doing some work, but Tom took me back to his workshop and showed me the project that he kind of does in his spare time, where he's the Co-inventor of this aircraft detector. So the idea is that telescopes are shooting lasers into the sky, and you don't want to hit an airplane that's passing by. You'd get a hole through the airplane? Yeah, just cut it right in half. So Tom's got this thing that he made. He's like soldering parts on a computer. I don't know. I can't even use the terminology right. Asher Miller We should talk about this because Elon Musk's DOGE will come around and just cancel that contract. Rob Dietz Right. But anyway, after spending time in that world, you know, what's really interesting is Tom's turn toward the limits to growth. So anyway, let's get you in here Tom and find out what's what. Tom Murphy Sure, just send me the link and I'll show up. Jason Bradford Oh my gosh. He's here. Asher Miller It's a miracle. Jason Bradford You happened to be free. Rob Dietz Thanks for joining us, Tom. Tom Murphy Sure. Jason Bradford So we want to throw this question that we've been asking ourselves: Extinct modernity, right? So I had Chuck E Cheese pizza time theater. Rob and Asher, I don't even remember their stuff. It was stupid. But anything that happened in the past that's now extinct that's part of modernity. What's your favorite? Tom Murphy Well, I really liked the discussion that you had. And you know, at first, I thought things like the space shuttle and the Concord represented a vision of where we thought we were going. And in fact, I put the space shuttle on the front of my textbook. And I didn't ever explicitly mention this, but in my mind is, where the hell does it think it's going? You know, it just sort of seemed like we all knew what was happening. I miss the the extinct threat of nuclear war. Jason Bradford I'm glad it's extinct. I didn't even know that. Asher Miller It's coming back, Tom. It's coming back. Tom Murphy I know, but didn't we have this period where that was just no longer on the radar. Jason Bradford Right. Ohhh. You miss when we thought it was extinct? Rob Dietz Yeah, I misinterpreted that too. I thought we got real dark there for a second. Asher Miller Like I love the duck and cover drills that we used to do. Tom Murphy Somewhat intentionally, you know, playing both sides there. But you know the radio button discussion, you know, still, when you design a GUI, which I've done a number of times, there's one choice for radio button. You know, because you can only select one of the boxes at a time, and that still harkens back to that mechanical, you know, push this thing and the dial actually zips to where you want it to go. And tha reminded me of, well, dialing is a thing that we still talk about on the phone. But there's no dial anymore, which is great, because, you know, if you had a number with a lot of eights and nines in it, you're waiting forever. Rob Dietz It was terrible. Asher Miller Yeah, your friends never called you. Rob Dietz This about the delayed gratification when you were making a 1-800 call to order whatever the album, Asher, that you were buying off a TV Asher Miller From Time Life. Rob Dietz You had to really want that album. Tom Murphy Zeros are the worst. And how many of our youth know? That zeros were terrible. So you know an area code, like 212, whoa. That was a special -- Yeah. So anyway, but it reminded me of observatories because I cut my teeth, in a sense, at Palomar Observatory on the 200 inch telescope, which is just a marvelous machine. It's really a piece of art. It's crafted. It's lovingly made. It was made during the depression years, and things slowed down a lot, but that meant that they took their time. Well, and they just did things differently in any case. And then you go to a telescope like the Keck telescope, you know, which I also worked at in Hawaii, which is a modern 10-meter telescope, and it just seems rickety. You know, the stair, just the stairs that you're walking on, the hand rail doesn't feel very substantial. It's all just sort of cutting corners. But the thing that reminded me of the Palomar was the radio button, because Palomar had this great thing called the Phantom. The Phantom was this mechanical analog to the telescope that was, you know, recognizably telescope shaped and it sat in a little sort of cabinet. And it mimicked the actions of the telescope. So, it moved as the telescope did, just mechanically through whatever moved the telescope, moved the Phantom. But the reason they had the Phantom was they needed to know where to point the dome. And the dome was -- Basically, the Phantom had two wires on either side of it. And if it touched one wire, it would say, ""Oh, we need to move the dome this way to keep it aligned. ""So, it was a very mechanical, ingenious solution. And, you know, since then, they've replaced it with barcode scanners. So, you know, they have barcodes all around the periphery and a little scanner so they always know where it is. And I don't know what the price accumulates to during a night as it beeps and, you know, adds up the items, but you know, I really missed that age when you had this really clever mechanical approach. And now it's replaced with more computerized things that can fail. And when they fail, it's hard. Like cars, also. I miss the car that I grew up, starting when I was 16 and started to drive, was a Chevy 1974, Chevy pickup truck, with a six-cylinder inline engine. And I am not exaggerating when I say that you could stand in the engine compartment with your feet on the ground next to the engine on either side, because you had that much room. And now you look at a car, and there are about 12 things in between you and the pavement. If you shot a laser, you know, you would hit 12 things. No matter where you go, it's just so completely packed, there's no standing in it. And there was just a simplicity. You could point to everything and say, ""That's what this does, that's what this does,"" and you could fix it. Now, when something breaks, it's kind of irreparable. Planned obsolescence. Yes. All in the name of efficiency. Asher Miller Well, so Tom I wanted to invite you into a conversation with us before we actually do this event that we're going to be hosting with Vanessa and Dougald because I know you've been on a bit of a journey around modernity and it's been interesting as someone who's been so steeped in it, I would say, to see you go through that journey a little bit. But before we get to that, maybe, I'd be curious how you define modernity, like if somebody asked you. Because I would think for a lot of people, they don't even know what we mean when we question it. Tom Murphy Yeah, at some level, I kind of like the ambiguity of the term, because it doesn't have baggage yet associated with it. And so, people are more willing to entertain the idea that modernity has a time limit, and that it's temporary. And there are a lot of things about modern life that people don't like and wouldn't mind seeing going. So, if you say civilization, people have a much greater attachment to that word, because it feels like the opposite is barbarism and violence, and that's a false kind of dichotomy. But the point is, modernity doesn't have that kind of emotional attachment, and so it can mean many things. It's obviously how we live today. It's our culture, it's fossil fuels, it's high energy, it's high material use, it's science, it's technology. And these things have been with us for, you know, centuries, but not millennia. But I would actually, in my mind, I extend modernity to, I mean, there are different ways to think of it, but it's also an attitude, it's an approach, it's a culture. And it's a culture of believing in mastery of we are the pinnacle species, the evolutionary end point, if you will. And this is all kind of a mythology, a cultural mythology, and I borrow heavily from Daniel Quinn's Ishmael here, where our mythology is that the world belongs to us, and you know, we were made to rule it and conquer it and master it. And once you have that attitude, which is pretty old -- that's older than modernity -- thousands of years. Asher Miller Yeah, that's older than modernity. Tom Murphy That is the central shift that paved the way for modernity because we just got better and better at enacting that attitude. But the attitude is thousands of years old, not millions like humans, or hundreds of thousands like Homo sapiens. And so, it's relatively new, and certainly in ecological evolutionary timescales, it's a flash. Even 10,000 years is a flash. So the agricultural revolution was one of conquering. It was one of control. It was deciding what should live and what should die, plants and animals. And it's all for us. It belongs to us -- Fences, animal enslavement, all kinds of things came with it. And then we just got better and better at it, and perfected the art of control. And science really helped that technology, really helped that fossil fuels, really accelerated it so, you know, but I don't see those elements as major turning points. The turning point was, I think, a much earlier one that really set the stage for modernity. And we've been that recognizable culture ever since. We don't identify culturally with, say, hunter gatherers, but we sure identify with a Mesopotamian. You know, we understand what they were after and how they approached the world. So that, to me is the big definer of modernity is, it's our attitude of how we comport ourselves on this planet. Rob Dietz So Tom, I don't want to like ascribe some attribute to you, but you know you're talking about the, you know, how we enacted this attitude of mastery and this art of control, but you were kind of ensconced in an arena that was really playing out that story, right? I mean, you're in an astrophysics department. You're doing things that are, you know, super, super high tech. I mean, honestly, I mean, I'm still, I find myself impressed, right? Like, I'm like, wow, you built this thing. Or, you know, how do you know how to do that? You know, I remember asking you that in your workshop. And you just talked about tinkering a lot with things as a kid, and just being really interested in it. Being steeped and at a place like that, in the university system, and kind of being in that culture in a big way, how did you get out of that? What's the journey to, you know, to saying the kinds of things that you just said, where you're recognizing this human supremacy in this culture that maybe won't work. One does not logically follow the other. So I'm curious, how did you get there? Tom Murphy I mean, I was definitely fully invested. I mean, I was all in as a member of modernity, doing exactly what you would hope a member of modernity would do. You know, shooting lasers at the moon. That's everybody's dream, right? So I think the way I see the journey is that I was always interested in understanding the path that we're on and trying to imagine where things are going. I grew up with Star Trek in the next generation as a teenager, and really loved it. And I think, you know, I never liked the original Star Trek because it just seemed too campy and nerdy. And I was not a real nerd kid. I only learned to do that later. But I really liked Spock because my family was so illogical. The guy was a beacon of logic, and so I really aspired to have that mental discipline and so forth. And so I think that was really influential. And I really loved the sort of fantasy world of, you know, the prime directive and all this, you know, enlightened future that we could embrace. And, you know, this was our path. And I was not questioning that really. It was exciting. The space shuttle was exciting. Here's, you know, our path into the stars and so forth. But, you know, as a kid, and now I associate those ideas with juvenile fantasy, right? And it's almost surprising to me to see the other people who have become adults and are still, you know, still there. Asher Miller Including the richest among us. Tom Murphy Absoletely. I mean, the biggest blind spot you can imagine. So, I think I was always interested in the future, and so I knew that energy was an important part of how we get things done. I mean, as a physicist, I clearly understood energy, and sort of physics owns energy, to some extent. And so, I was interested in teaching a course my first year at UC San Diego on energy in the environment. It's a general education course for non-science majors. And I thought, I'll pick this one. You know, I had a menu of what courses would you like to teach, and so nobody had claimed that one. And then I thought I would learn a lot. And I did. You know, I already knew that solar was so abundant that it's almost a no brainer that, of course, we'd just switch to solar when fossil fuels go away and it helps the CO2 problem and everything. So, you know, done, right? A simple premise and a simplistic, stripped down, decontextualized world has very simple solutions. And so it just seemed pretty obvious. But the more I looked into it, the more I realized it's hard. And I did my own solar setup. And I started small with one panel and a battery and a charge controller. And then I said, what about this other kind of panel, and this other kind of battery, and this other kind of charge controller, and let me just sort of get my feel for this. And I put just my television on it at first, and then I got another panel and another battery and put the living room lights on it. And then I thought, you know what'd be really cool is to run my refrigerator off of this. So more panels and more battery, and, you know. And it basically was an off grid system. And I was in a condo at the time, and, you know, had the landlord's permission to put a hole through the wall for an extension cord. And so I was just really kind of crude, but I learned so much, and the energy became very personal because I worked so hard to get it. And so watching TV, and I learned this was back in, you know, in a cathode ray tube, and it turns out that the darker the movie, the less energy it takes. Because you're lighting up the electron beam les. And that's not true now with, you know, LCD TVs where you have a backlight that's just full on, and then you have things to suppress the light coming through, but there's some variance on that. But still, I learned so much about living with your own energy, and the difficulties of off grid storage, intermittent power supplies, what do storms mean, what do, you know, periods of bad weather mean? But my approach was, let's technology our way out of this. You know, we're smart and clever people, and this is what we do. But the more I looked into it, the more I realized how much of a kind of House of Cards this whole business was and how there were some glaring weak spots. You know, growth itself is just a non-starter for long term success. But even at steady state, you can't maintain a steady state at billions of humans living a modern lifestyle. It's just a temporary stunt. So yeah, the more I realized -- And it's sort of came to closing exits, one after the other, where I just always assumed that we would figure it out. And now I've gotten to the point where I realize how naive that vision is because, you know, we construct mental models in our brains that -- Our brains are limited, by the way. I mean, they're organs. They're evolved to do certain things, and they do certain things pretty well, and they give us flexibility, but they're limited. They have, you know, only so much capacity, and something like an evolved ecology is so complicated and so many interconnections and dependencies and relationships that we barely scratch the surface of understanding. Our brains are just incapable of the kind of wisdom that an ecology expresses that's formed over deep time. And we're just simply incapable. And I think of it kind of like the ravenous bug bladder beast from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide. That's so stupid that if you to evade it, all you have to do is cover your eyes, because it figures if you can't see it, it can't see you, right? But we're almost as bad as that. Because if an ecology can't see its way into our brain, we assume it doesn't exist. And there are a lot of things that don't fit into our brains, into our mental models. Most things don't. And so we have this bias toward our models, toward the map and not the territory, so that we assume if it doesn't fit in our brain, it might as well not exist. And you'll see this all the time with, I don't see why not, is a common response to why we won't go to Mars, or why we won't keep modernity going forever. I don't see why not. It's like, yes, that's precisely the problem, you know, but thanks for admitting it. That's very big of you and an important step to realize that you don't see why not, and that's okay. We're not expected to see everything. Asher Miller I think you're right that that is actually progress for someone to say, ""I don't see why not."" Because a lot of what we see, we had a conversation not too long ago talking about this series of articles that the New York Times published on the future of the food system. And one of the things we talked about was that you start from these assumptions of how things must be, and then you try to figure out how those assumptions are going to get fulfilled, right? So, the assumption is people are going to continue to want to live in the desert. We're going to still need to consume the food the way that we do. It's like, of course, more people in the future are going to be consuming more energy. Like, that's just obvious. And so we just have to figure out how to how to solve that problem, versus questioning whether or not that assumption is even true in the first place. Tom Murphy Right. Yeah. I mean, the world doesn't bend itself to our will, which is why we've thought we had to conquer, you know, when the pests come in to eat our row crops. We have to, you know, how dare they? That's ours. We have to do something about it. And so, yeah, the universe is really not on board with just making sure that our schemes work. And you know, it's going to fight back. Jason Bradford One of the things that I have trouble with continually is knowing all this and then still living in modernity and wondering, you know, is there a way where I can start practicing or trialing post modernity ways of life.And it becomes really hard to do. I often joke that I'm sorry I didn't grow up as a Romanian peasant because I was spending time with Chuck E Cheese pizza time theater instead of, you know, learning how to do all the things that someone as a kid would just normally get up and do. And so, when you see people from these other cultures, and I know Rob has a fan, he's like watching some of these YouTubes of these people that like, know how to live out in nature and have these incredible skill sets. And what do I do? I teach tennis. I teach kids how to hit a fuzzy yellow ball with a graphene racket and and poly strings on a concrete court with painted lines. I love doing it. It's a lot of fun. But I almost wish, like, could these parents pay me to teach their kids to do something else? But it's not just not part of our culture, right? It's like, it's easy money to teach people how to play tennis, but if you say, I'm going to try to teach us and learn how to live without all the trappings of modernity. You know, it's just like, good luck. That's not much of a viable business, I don't think. Or maybe it is. Maybe I should try that. But I don't think I'd get very much interest, honestly. So what do you do? What do you do? Like, you know, as somebody who grew up in all this and knows the BS, but you don't have the skill set, and the vast majority of people around you aren't even interested. Tom Murphy Yeah, I think I look at the longer game here, because I don't think I am personally going to exit modernity. I mean, I'm steeped in it. It's all I know. I don't have the skill sets, or, most importantly, the community, because it's not an individualistic approach. We're not the rugged individuals we pretend to be. We're a species that's, you know, contextualized to group survival and working cooperatively within that fairly small band. So that's very unlikely to ever be my reality. And I don't stress about it too much. I don't think that by next week I have to be out. You know, it's not going to happen, and modernity took a while to build. It's not going to necessarily take 10,000 years that it took to get to this point to unwind, but it can take generations. And it will take generations. I mean, some things will go away fast, and then some things will, you know, cling for for maybe centuries, recognizable elements of modernity. And each child that's born into the conditions that exist at that time will just accept those conditions as normal and get on with life. We're very plastic and adaptable, not necessarily as individuals, but as a species because we're just sort of almost blank slates, but with some decent instincts that are honed by evolution to work together, to be cooperative, to be observant, to be creative in how we adapt to a changing situation. And so that's, I think, going to be the story. And the people listening to this don't have to stress about not getting it right and propagating this machine. But the thing that I try to do most is just, I'm no longer in love with modernity, and talk of it as an abusive partner that said nice things to me occasionally and brought me flowers, but really, you know, at the cost of a sixth mass extinction. And so, there's kind of this dark side to it that I shouldn't really embrace. And so, I just don't care to propagate all of those trappings. And I can dial it down. I don't have to stop it, but I can be part of the off ramp by just sort of not playing the game the same way, not being a consumer, not supporting fantasies politically. Jason Bradford The problem is, it's hard not to be a consumer. I mean, Asher gets pissed off every time he's like, ""Oh God, I've gotta order something from Amazon."" And he's just mad. He's just mad because he's like, I don't have another -- What choice do I have? And I kind of feel like, every once in a while, my family says, ""Can you please go pick something up at Safeway?"" And I'm just like, ""Argh."" And then they know, like, I'm gonna break out in hives when I walk in and see the mylar balloons, you know, right in the front because of whatever holiday is coming up, and the stacks of soda cans. So it jars me. Like you're saying, it's like, you know, oh, do I have to go back into this abusive relationship here and just dip my toe in it continually. And that's kind of what it feels like. Because I sort of see through what it took to fill this store up with, you know, all this junk, all this cargo, and I'm mad sometimes because I feel like everybody around me is in this cargo cult, and I don't want to be there all the time. So I guess, you know, you find your ways to sort of stay out as much as you can, is what you're saying, even though you you can't help it a little bit. Because, like you say, we're really a social species, and so without -- Like I said, if I had 50 kids that wanted to learn something besides tennis, but I don't. So what do I do? Right? Tom Murphy Yeah, well, I know what you do, Jason. I know you go look at birds. Jason Bradford Yeah, I do, yeah. Tom Murphy Yeah, exactly. And that's fantastic, because they don't care about tennis, and they don't care about what's in Safeway, yeah. And if you ask them about what's going on in, you know, Trump world right now, they don't care. And there's a wisdom there. And I'm not being flippant about the word wisdom here because a wisdom that took millions upon millions of years to establish itself and establish itself as survivable, as you know, a presence, has gotten a lot of things right. And the fact that the birds, and I see newts around my place and love them to bits, and I really take a lesson from the fact that they're just living by the laws of life. So what we've done is we've created an artificial world out of our brains. And I think of modernity as a big brain fart. You know? And I might be a little hesitant to use such foul language on any other podcast, but you guys, you know, I've listened to your show. So yeah. I mean, it's just this concoction, this fabrication that's not grounded and doesn't have the same kind of wisdom. It's just sort of a look what I can do stunt. No hands. Wow, look at that. The animals and the plants don't go in for all that, and they're better for it. And so we ought to actually take something from that and realize that we can't just make it all up on our heads and expect it to work. Rob Dietz Jason, you would be one of those bowerbirds that is pulling mylar balloons and plastic spoons and other stuff to build your nest. Jason Bradford I sometimes wish I was a bird because then I could just fly around and I could land in that tree, and I could take my little beak into the lichen and moss and find little bugs and, you know, make a little nest and yeah. You know, they just know how to live in that forest or whatever, or stick their bill in the ground and pick out things. I can't even see what they're eating. I know they're finding food. You know, who does that around here are the orioles when they make their nest. It really bums me out. Asher Miller Well, they're just, you know, they're, working with what's in the environment. Yeah, the thing that I appreciate what you said Tom just about not beating yourself up for participating in modernity, but also maybe practicing some sort of detachment, I guess a little bit. I feel batted back and forth between feeling trapped, frankly, in the reality that we currently live in, when I know, to the degree that I do the consequences of it. will you end already? You know, like I have sometimes this sort of this impatience though. I don't want it to end, and certainly not end badly or quickly. I also, I think there are moments where I deeply appreciate the benefits we've had from modernity and like wanting to appreciate it as much as I possibly can if I recognize that it's fleeting. Jason Bradford Like Quadrophenia. Asher Miller No, like we're able to have this conversation and not be in the same room together. It would be much more lovely, frankly, to be in a room together. But I am fortunate in my work to have conversations on a weekly basis with people all around the world that I would have never gone to meet or learn from. That's an absolute gift of modernity. So . . . Rob Dietz Yeah, or when you have a tooth problem, you go to a dentist. You don't have to, like, knock it out with a rock, you know? That's a pretty sweet deal in modernity. Asher Miller That's true. But the other thing that I really struggle with is the fact that we're actually on an acceleration path with modernity still, or at least the technological elements of modernity. Jason Bradford Yeah, AI stuff. Asher Miller And in fact, I feel like the people, you mentioned that maybe modernity as a concept is more it's less loaded for people as something to question than something like civilization, right? Because that feels more threatening to them. And I see that. I think people are increasingly feeling the ill effects of how modernity manifests itself in their lives now. I mean, you look at, we talked about the food system earlier, you look at just the deeply unhealthy nature of the modern food system and what it's doing to people's bodies, I think. But also communications technology, the internet, social media, these kinds of things. I think that might actually be the fact that it's accelerating so much, and it's so ubiquitous, and it's sort of conquered us on some level. That might be the actual thing that has people be more receptive to a message of modernity coming to an end. They may not recognize that it's going to come to an end, whether we fucking like it or not. But, they may be more open to thinking about it ending because they're seeing that it's not benefiting them as much. I don't know. Tom Murphy Yeah, I do think a lot of people are aware that things aren't quite right, and that things are maybe going a bit sideways, and the dream is not being fulfilled. I believe that, you know, 75 years ago, it was fairly widespread sense that we're aiming for, you know, ever better world. We're going to craft it. We finally have the tools to craft it the way we want. We have the energy and the power, and it hasn't gone so well. And it's also, by the way, initiating a sixth mass extinction, which is pretty serious, because a heavy primate that is high maintenance and, you know, hungry, is not going to fare well in a six mass extinction scenario. Short of that, you said that like it or not, modernity is going to end. And that's absolutely true. And even just from a materials point of view. I mean, you know, we've taken the low hanging fruit in just a few centuries, and most of it in the last 50 years. I mean, the pace is extreme. And so, you can't really keep this pace up for even 1,000 years, 10,000 years. So modernity will starve itself of metals on that time frame. And the other thing that I recognize is that, you know, the materials that we use in modernity are not of this ecological world. We dig them out of the ground, and they're not part of the circulation in the community of life that we use. In fact, 96% of our mass comes from air and water, reconstituted, reorganized. But the, you know, the oxygen, the carbon, the hydrogen, the nitrogen, is all from air and water. And then only 4%, you know, a lot of calcium, phosphorus -- Jason Bradford Potassium. Tom Murphy Potassium, yeah, are in common circulation in community of life. But not copper, not magnesium. Well, little, tiny bit of magnesium. But, you know, titanium. Asher Miller Well, you know, trying to put that into our bodies as much as possible, Tom. Tom Murphy Yeah, exactly. Yeah, aluminum, you know, these are weird, exotic things that we're spewing. You know, maybe not intentionally, maybe not, you know, immediately, but if it comes out of the ground, it ends up in the environment, You know, on the Millennium timescale that's just out there. And the community of life doesn't know what to do with it. And sometimes it's innocuous, but more often than not, it actually causes problems. And so not only are we going to starve ourselves of these metals if we tried to continue modernity, but it's contributing that their use and dispersal contribute to sickness and ailing in the physical world, biophysical world. So yeah, we don't really have a choice to continue it. It's not a long-term viable mode of living on this planet. I think you know in terms of giving it up or letting it go, a little bit of detachment goes a long way. That's something that can be a little bit contagious in the sense that we take cues from each other in our culture, and we're a social species. And so, if a number of us react to this sense that things aren't going according to the dream, and that the dream was never realistic, maybe more detachment among more people will have pretty serious consequences and will kind of get out in front. All the video, you know, TikTok and whatever is part of the phenomenon that detaches us from ourselves, and that is having consequences in terms of fertility. And so we're going to see this big demographic shift in this second half, or maybe even the first half of the century. We'll see possibly a peak of global population, and it's going to be big news. And how we react to that is going to be fascinating. I mean, some people are saying we just need to make more babies. Elon Musk is on like, is on the job, man. He's trying to make as many babies as he can right now. That's right. And, you know, JD Vance, similar. I mean, a lot of these folks are like, we need to become baby factories. But I don't think it's gonna work, and so But then some people will embrace it and say, ""You know what? This is actually -- maybe we can make this into a good thing."" And so that's kind of where I am on it. Rob Dietz So Tom, I really appreciate the way you framed the idea that modernity is a temporary stunt. You know, it's like a Red Bull mountain biker coming down a cliff, doing a double back flip without touching the handlebars, or whatever. You know, it's like, ""Wow, look what we can do."" Tom Murphy Or the show ""Jackass"" comes to mind. Rob Dietz Well especially when I'm talking it does. I actually can't believe that I'm not talking about the other thing. You called it a big brain fart. That's more up my alley, but anyway, this this idea of a temporary stunt, and then falling out of love with temporary stunts like, you know, eventually kind of saying, yeah that's fine that I could do that, but did I really need to, you know, and at what cost? And so, you know, I've heard your recommendation is try to detach yourself from that. But what I'm wondering that maybe you could share with listeners is, how do you talk to other people about that? Do you just tell them about your experience and what's happened with you to kind of start what you called a contagious detachment. Like, how? How do you, you know, let's say you're wandering around the physics department at your university, and people are like, this is not on their radar whatsoever. I mean, how would somebody out there broach the topic and start to make some headway? You know, what does Jason tell his tennis students, you know, that gets them on a path towards wanting to be birds as well? Tom Murphy So I was reminded of a, and by the way, before I forget this one, you talked about, you know, being enamored of the stunt and falling out of love with the stunt, but you also prefer brain fart. So you need to fall out of love with the smell of your own brain fart. I mean, people like their own brand sometimes, but you just -- That's disgusting. So yeah, I was reminded of the secret handshake kind of thing where I had a friend who moved to Utah. It was a couple who moved to Utah. And he was describing, you know, it's Mormon country, and he's not Mormon, but he was saying that when you plan some event with somebody who you barely know, you're just trying to get to know people, and you're trying to find a time when you can do something. You're like, well, Saturday, I'm doing something, but what about Sunday? And you just totally float out there because if they're Mormon then absolutely not. And if they're like, ""Yes, Sunday would work,"" You're like, ""Great, let's be friends."" You know? It's like, you like cream soda? I like cream soda too. We'll be best friends. So, um, yeah, it is kind of like that. Asher Miller So we need certain like secret words or secret signals to the other modernity questioning people. Tom Murphy Yeah. because I would have my ears out and, you know, listen for any hints from other people. And I would drop some hints, you know, about how I think about things. And occasionally you'd run into somebody who catches the hint, and then you start talking. But it's not something that I could walk up to anybody in my department and just sort of have an interesting, fruitful discussion about modernity and its temporary nature. And same among my friends. I mean, I've got a lot of really good friends who basically just don't want to talk about this stuff and d I don't push it, you know, because I want to stay friends. And I had a friend that came from, you know, that I hadn't seen in 30 years. A college roommate who came and stayed with me and his wife, and, you know, it was great fun to catch up. And I might have dropped a few little hints of where I am now, but I didn't really want to burden that fun experience with, oh, by the way, here's why I think this is all going, you know, south. So I don't know. It is a bit isolating. AnI was thinking about that Asher, when you were talking about how you're able to connect with people internationally. But I think when you're in such a rarefied place of having this view, you kind of need that community, and you need to go far and wide to find it. Asher Miller That's true, yeah. Tom Murphy Because, you know, you can't just go to your next door neighbor and expect to connect over this kind of issue. Rob Dietz When they complain like traffic's bad, you can't go, Yeah, and civilization is collapsing. It doesn't really work, does it? Asher Miller Well you can if you want to end conversations quickly, which is what I like to do sometimes, you know, because I'm an introvert and I don't like people. I think it's a good recommendation, maybe for our listeners, who obviously -- The ones who bother to listen to more than one episode I think are folks who kind of are inhabiting the same sort of space as us, and maybe this is a secret handshake kind of community that they're also part of. So, what I'm taking away is not riddling ourselves with guilt, not expecting ourselves to completely detach, but to maybe detach a bit emotionally or in terms of our identity to what is modernity now. And then, maybe, you know, dropping little seeds every once in a while in interactions with people that maybe some people pick up and ask a question about it. You know, I think even just naming things as not being permanent can be useful. Tom Murphy Well, and we make decisions all the time that might have some long-term ramifications, like. Like, you know, the road that I live on is private road, and it's in fine shape. It was paved, you know, probably 30 years ago. And it's okay. It's a light use road, but at some point it'll need resurfacing. And it makes sense to resurface it if modernity is just continuing for a long time, but a lot of things don't make sense anymore if it's just a temporary stunt. And that's what part of the falling out of love is about. It is in the detachment. It is recognizing that, wait, why am I doing this thing if our future doesn't look like what we were all told our future was going to look like. What does it really mean, and why am I doing this? And so that that's a big part of it is always asking yourself, why am I doing this in the context that this is temporary. Rob Dietz Yeah, I guess a takeaway I'll throw out there is that falling out of love with modernity just opens up more space to fall more deeply in love with the complexity of the ecosystems that you inhabit. Tom Murphy You bet. Rob Dietz I try really hard to be observant of what's going on in the places that I inhabit. And observant of the things nature is doing, not observant of all the hubbub of modernity. And it's hard to do, but I think the more you can focus on that, the healthier you are, and the more in the future you'll be able to make decisions like, yeah, let's not resurface this. Let's let it return to a path and eventually to a forest, or whatever it's going to be. Asher Miller I appreciate you coming and sharing this with us, Tom. Just a little bit about your journey and the way that you think of it. I think it's inspiring and hopeful for me to know someone who I would say, you could have been very well excused to have stayed embedded in modernity, you know, considering the work that you're doing, what you studied, and all that. And for you to not only step out of it and question it, but I think in what you do at Do the Math, your blog. Tom Murphy Which you started by the way. You realize that? Asher Miller Yeah, no, we talked about that. You did it, nan, that's all you. Tom Murphy No, but that's part of the journey. And I forgot to mention it. Is that you're an important part of that in encouraging me to put these ideas out. Asher Miller We've heard from a lot of people who have been following your writings, and I think it's helped them on their journey. So anyways, I hope that folks listening maybe want to join the conversation that we're going to have with Vanessa and Dougald, who also have been thinking very deeply about this, and just naming something that every one of us has tended to take for granted as an absolute. Just naming it as sort of the emperor s clothes thing, you know, is an important first step. So maybe we'll see you in person soon and we can go back out on those kayaks. Yeah, I'd love to have you come up here, or, you know, I want to go down your way sometime soon. And Jason will have you harvesting potatoes. Tom Murphy Sounds like he's going to have me working on my forehand. Jason Bradford Yeah, that too. We can do both. Asher Miller With potatoes. You could be hitting the potatoes with the racket. Jason Bradford I could show you the local newt pond we have here, you know, so They're probably mating right now if you want to come by. Tom Murphy Yeah, actually here they're heading to the mating zone. I see them heading north to their little mating pond. Rob Dietz Alright you guys, leave the newts alone to do their thing.

We are in a full-blown crisis of free speech. Earlier this month, ICE agents detained Mahmoud Khalil, a green-card holder, with plans to deport him because of the content of his speech. Trump banned AP reporters from press briefings after the AP refused to use the phrase “Gulf of America” instead of “Gulf of Mexico” in its style guide. And the administration is following through on threats to withdraw funding from universities that allowed disfavored speech. While Trump will lose in court on many of his efforts, many corporate, university, and nonprofit leaders are quietly obeying in advance, avoiding conflict.

In the 1960s, the Free Speech Movement was a rallying cry for students and activists who understood that the right to dissent, argue, and speak freely was essential to democracy. Today, we need a new Free Speech Movement—and not just a retread of the 1960s. A new free speech movement would recognize that both the direct authoritarian power-grabs of the Trump administration, and the power grabs of private monopolist entities represent a significant danger.Trump’s oligarchs—his big tech allies who control the flow of news and information—are themselves an independent threat to open society.

For decades, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was seen as the gold standard for defending free speech. It stood up for the right of Nazis to march in Skokie, and forcefully argued that the principle of free expression mattered more than the content of any particular speech. But in the past 10 years, several critics—including former executive cirector of the ACLU Ira Glasser—have persuasively argued that the ACLU has compromised or even abandoned those values, choosing cases on the basis of a particular substantive vision, instead of fiercely protecting speech regardless of its content.

One of its most notorious missteps came when a high-level ACLU lawyer argued in favor of getting Amazon to ban a book, saying, “Stopping the circulation of this book and these ideas is 100% a hill I will die on.” This claim was not just a stupid tweet by an activist; it revealed a fundamental and long-standing misunderstanding of how consolidated corporate power threatens free speech.

In the ACLU vision, private power never poses a risk to free expression. If Instagram wants to suppress Palestinian content (as credible reporting suggested it did), that does not implicate democracy, regardless of Instagram’s market share.

When Biden’s DOJ fought to stop a merger between two book publishing goliaths, recognizing that authors having multiple possible outlets is essential to free expression, the ACLU remained silent. Instead, it has repeatedly filed briefs on behalf of Big Tech, defending Silicon Valley’s freedom to act as unaccountable monopolists, claiming that the state has no right to regulate the design of big tech, even if that regulation would make it more content-neutral.

This is not a new phenomenon. The ACLU was one of the driving forces behind Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court case that held that money is speech, and the organization boasts that the ACLU “created much of the constitutional framework that has constrained all federal campaign finance legislation.” It was behind several subsequent challenges to campaign finance laws, and was also a strong supporter of the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United, filing a brief stating that corporations should have the right to spend unlimited money in elections.

Such views reveal the crucial weakness of the 1960s free speech movement—namely, its neoliberal core, that refuses to understand how power works, and understands censorship in a wholly formal way confined to governmental actors.

Even if that approach might have seemed plausible 30 years ago, it has long since passed its sell-by date. Trump’s oligarchy requires us to build a newer, deeper, more principled understanding of free speech—one that sees both government suppression and private censorship as real dangers to democratic debate and human freedom.","Activism / Anti-Monopolist / America Needs a New Free Speech Movement Donald Trump is showing us what an unaccountable class of corporate decision-makers looks like—and it looks like a lot of fear, and a terrible loss of freedom.

Amazon,"The Naga-Sobhita Love Story ""Began With An Ask Me Anything Session""","We can't get enough of Sobhita Dhulipala and Naga Chaitanya's love story. Months after their traditional wedding, the couple shared some more inside stories from their courtship period in an interview with Vogue. Sobhita Dhulipala revealed the love story, actually, began with an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session.

Sobhita shared that a fan dropped a message on her Instagram why she's not following Naga Chaitanya. Hardly the fan knew that he/she had played a cupid in the Naga Chaitanya-Sobhita Dhulipala relationship unwittingly.

""I was sifting through the questions when I saw one that asked, 'Why aren't you following Chay Akkineni?' I was like, 'What?' So I went to his profile and saw that he was following only around 70 people, including me. I was a tiny bit flattered, so I followed him back,"" Sobhita shared.

As soon as they started following each other, they started talking via DMS. Love blossomed and Naga Chaitanya booked his flight to meet Sobhita over a breakfast in Mumbai.

Earlier, Naga Chaitanya shared details of their romance in other interviews.

A week later, they met again at an Amazon Prime Video event in Mumbai. That summer, they went on their first trip together to Bandipur National Park in Karnataka with Chaitanya's friends. Sobhita shared, ""I'm the fluttering kite and he's the anchor. Our dissimilarities really kept us interested and curious about each other.""

Later that year, they went to London to attend a concert. She celebrated New Year's eve with his family. The following year, 2023, he met her family in Visakhapatnam. In August, he proposed to her during their Goa trip.

Sobhita and Naga Chaitanya had an intimate wedding in December, last year at the iconic Annapurna Studios in the presence of friends and family members.

Naga Chaitanya was earlier married to Samantha Ruth Prabhu. They got divorced in 2021.","We can't get enough of Sobhita Dhulipala and Naga Chaitanya's love story.

Amazon,Komoot’s Expanded Paywalls: Trying to make sense of it,"Over the last few weeks, Komoot has pretty significantly expanded the moat around their platform, specifically when it comes to doing (executing) the very routes you create on Komoot. Going forward (from Feb 27th, 2025), all new users of the platform will require a Premium subscription ($59/year) in order to sync those routes to connected devices, such as a Garmin/Wahoo/Hammerhead/etc…This will not affect any accounts that purchased something from Komoot prior to that point (either a paid map unlock, or a Premium membership).

Still, this is a pretty big deal, at least in terms of the future of Komoot. It obviously isn’t going to impact most existing customers (unless you had a free Komoot account for some time, but never used the sync feature, and now want to). Some have said this is Komoot saying “we don’t want any new customers”, and to be honest, there’s a pretty strong nugget of truth there. Yet, at the same time, there’s also a reality that Komoot is a business. And free users only take you so far. That’s no different than any business. You don’t pay the bills with free.

So, let’s take a closer look at exactly what’s changing, isn’t changing, and what this means relative to the competition.

What Changes?

First up, for those not familiar with Komoot, at its core, it’s a route-planning platform. Their strength has historically been more European-centric than other regions, but there’s still a boatload of content beyond Europe. Their secondary strength has been the ability to plan tours (e.g., multi-day or multi-route efforts) as a cohesive thing, establishing not just collections but also adding photos and descriptions for those collections. Whereas most other routing/mapping providers tend to skew towards per-route features. Meaning, each route is a route unto itself, rather than being seen as part of a larger collection. Again, others like RideWithGPS can do collective routes too, but collections has long been Komoot’s main jam.

Ok, setting that aside, let’s talk about what you could (and can still do) within Komoot.

Planning routes: This piece, the act of creating a route, you can still do with a free account, just like before. That remains the same.

Doing the routes: This is the piece that changes. And ‘doing’ has three core feature areas: Downloading a GPX file, doing the route with the Komoot app, and syncing the route with a connected device like a Garmin/Wahoo/Polar/COROS/Suunto/Hammerhead/etc…

Option 1 – Downloading a GPX File: This requires either a map unlock, or a premium subscription. In other words, you can create routes all day long, but at the end of the day, if you want to download that route and actually do it, you’re gonna have to pay. The map unlock fee lets you do a one-time region unlock that lets you ‘own’ that region for future purposes.

The regions tend to be very small (literally a single 8.99EUR region is barely 1/3rd of the island I live on). But, Komoot lets you pay a 19.99EUR one-time fee to unlock the entire world (it’s 29EUR normally, but a new account gets a 10EUR discount for the first 10 days). Thus obviously, if you ever plan to use Komoot again, it probably makes sense for the one-time 20EUR payment:

Once that’s done, you can download that GPX file, and any future files for routes you create within the region you bought (either that tiny sliver of a region, or the entire world unlock). To reiterate, none of those features have changed at all (well, at least anytime that I can remember).

Option 2 – Komoot App Navigation:

Now, the second option you’ve got to ‘do’ the routes you create is the Komoot app. This includes offline access for the maps, turn-by-turn prompts, voice navigation, and a pile of other features. This, too, though, requires some sort of purchase. Either the map unlock I described above, or Komoot Premium. Below are the extra features. The first column on both chunks is if you pay for a map unlock, the second column is with Premium:

Again, none of the above has actually changed at all relative to the payment required for Komoot app navigation. The shifting into Premium has changed in recent years, but it did at least always require some sort of payment (map unlocks) previously.

Option 3 – Native Device Integration:

Lastly, and probably of most interest to people here, is the syncing of a route to your 3rd party device. Examples being Garmin devices, Hammerhead, Wahoo, Polar, Suunto, COROS, and probably others as well. This now requires not just a map unlock like it did previously, but now the Premium subscription. That subscription is $4.99/month or $59/year (parity pricing in EUR & GBP). Previously, simply unlocking the applicable map region would do the trick (or the world unlock for $20-$30.)

And this is where things get messy. Up till now, you could buy a single region the activity was in (as cheap as $3 in some cases) and be cooking. Now, you’re looking at a monthly/annual fee, simply to sync the route to your device. This will be a substantial barrier to getting new users onto the platform, especially if those new users are coming via event-type websites. Events will often share links to routes on Komoot, Strava, RideWithGPS, and others – usually picking a single partner in most cases. But none of the others require payment to simply ride the route in question.

If we compare Strava, they require payment (a subscription) to *create* a route, but not to ride/run/sync that route. This means that others can create and share a route, and then you simply add it to your saved/favorites, and it syncs to your device in question (or you can download the GPX file). No payment is required to sync a route to your device (Garmin/Wahoo/etc). Strava only requires a premium subscription if you wish to save the entire offline map area to your Strava app on your phone.

Likewise, RideWithGPS is the same. It does not require a payment/subscription to sync routes to your device. Last week, I was going on a week-long gravel bike ride in Morocco, and the company uses RideWithGPS for all their routes. They’ve got these route collections made, and I was simply invited to the route collection for that ride, which synced all of those routes to all of my devices (COROS/Wahoo/Hammerhead/Garmin), instantly, without any payment.

You can see here, how RideWithGPS splits up its tiers:

As seen above, RideWithGPS does not require a subscription to plan routes, explore routes, or sync with various bike computers.

Wrap-Up:

Only Komoot knows, or will soon know, whether or not this strategy will work. Obviously, as I alluded to at the beginning, Komoot is a business, and ultimately, it’s the goal of the business to increase revenue. However, where it gets tricky is crowd-sourced platforms like Komoot. While Komoot certainly pays for certain mapping/trail/etc data, they’re also *HEAVILY* dependent on user data to contribute photos, actual trail usage data, and plenty more.

In fact, I’d argue that user-generated content, like its extensive uploaded photos, collections, and the like, is the single biggest differentiator between Komoot and other platforms. Even despite Strava adding photos to Strava Routes/maps in recent years, it’s still not as easy to see those photos in all Strava apps/platforms/places. Let alone things like route collections, which Strava announced two years ago, and I’ll be darned if I can find any reference to that actually arriving/happening.

I suspect within 30-60 days, we’ll know whether or not Komoot’s big shift is the right one. They’ll easily be able to look at year-over-year trends, and see whether new-user sign-ups (and more specifically revenue) are up or down. That said, given they didn’t sideswipe existing users, the trickle-down effect could take longer to manifest itself.

Still, I can’t help but think that long-term this move will hurt them. I totally understand their push for users to Premium, but in an ever-increasing landscape of subscription offerings, it’s going to be hard for many users to justify yet another monthly/annual subscription, simply to sync a route. Just my two cents.

With that, thanks for reading!

Amazon,"I Am Totally Ready For Reacher Season 4, But I Also Have Questions About The Amazon Prime TV Show's Next Big Adventure","I am already as excited for Reacher Season 4 as Alan Ritchson’s titular hero is large in stature. I was hooked on developer Nick Santora’s adaptation of author Lee Child’s bestselling novel series from the start, but I think the third season of Reacher has been the strongest yet, which is why I am especially looking forward to what the next return of one of the best Amazon Prime original TV shows has in store.

While Reacher Season 4 was announced even before the third season became available to stream with an Amazon Prime subscription, there is still much that we do not know about Jack Reacher’s next run-in with trouble. So, naturally, I have a few questions regarding what we can expect when the action-packed Amazon Prime original returns.

Quick Facts About Reacher Season 4

(Image credit: Prime Video)

Before I get into what I do not know, but desperately want to know, about Reacher Season 4, here is a quick breakdown of all the facts we thankfully have at our disposal for now:

Reacher Season 4 Currently Has No Premiere Date

According To Lee Child (via TechRadar ), Reacher Season 4 Starts Shooting Summer 2025

A Neagley Spin-Off Is In The Works

Stream Amazon Prime Video for $8.99 per month Access to countless great movies and TV shows comes built-in with a subscription to Amazon Prime for $14.99 a month, or $139 for an entire year. However, non-Prime users can also stream cinematic shows like Reacher for the low monthly price of $8.99.

Questions I Have About Reacher Season 4

(Image credit: Prime Video)

Having followed the series since the beginning, I have a relatively decent idea of what I can expect from the fourth season. For instance, there is a strong chance we will see Alan Ritchson in one of his best roles kicking ass left and right alongside his latest love interest over the course of eight episodes. That being said, there are still a few things about the series’ next installment that I am still in the dark about.

What Book Will Reacher Season 4 Adapt?

(Image credit: Amazon MGM)

This is usually the first question anyone asks when the latest season of Reacher is greenlit. Following Paramount’s two feature-length adaptations from 2012 and 2016 (which were based on One Shot and Never Go Back), the first season of the show took inspiration from Lee Child’s debut novel, 1997’s Killing Floor, before Season 2 skipped over to the 11th installment, Bad Luck and Trouble, and Season 3 went in reverse, and brought the seventh Jack Reacher novel, Persuader, to life.

As of March 2025, it is anybody’s guess which of Child’s 29 books will serve as the source material for the upcoming season. The author did tell The Independent in February that his choice would be his 22nd novel, 2017’s The Midnight Line, which sees Reacher taking on the illegal opioid trade. Considering the real-world relevance of that topic, I agree that would be a fantastic choice for the character’s next small-screen adventure, but what if the show went in a different direction?

Will Reacher Season 4 Be An Original Story Instead?

(Image credit: Prime Video)

Obviously, there would be no Reacher without the acclaimed work of Child, whose words have genuinely inspired some of the most suspenseful, exciting, and fun television I have seen in my lifetime. However, are there any other fans like me who would be curious to see the show tell a completely new story that is not based on a novel for Season 4?

I feel that, at this point in the show’s astonishingly successful run, it has earned the right to try something new and attempt to put Reacher in a situation that not even the most die-hard fans of the books will be able to see coming. I realize there is still a great deal of source material for Santora and co. to borrow from, but I am also deeply confident that they will have plenty of chances to bring many of those stories to life in future installments, which is why it might be worth it to experiment with going off track at least once.

How Much Will Neagley Be Involved This Time?

(Image credit: Sophie Giraud/Prime)

Reacher’s longtime friend and former colleague, Frances Neagley, was not introduced until Lee Child’s sixth book, Without Fail. However, the army ranger turned private investigator was brought into the series with a four-episode arc in Season 1, as portrayed by Maria Sten, and has practically become its co-lead ever since. This begs the question, will Reacher lose its co-lead in Season 4?

Before Season 3 debuted, Amazon announced that Neagley would lead her own spin-off series, which Sten revealed was in production with an Instagram post from February 2025. Considering that the fourth set of episodes still have some time before the cameras start rolling, it is not completely out of the question that the breakfast cereal-loving badass could be involved in some way. However, I imagine that her screen time will be significantly reduced from her starring role in Season 2, much like it was for Season 3.

Will Tom Cruise Make A Cameo?

At the time I write this, despite my affinity for the TV series, I have actually seen neither of the feature-length adaptations of Child’s books, 2012’s Jack Reacher and 2016’s Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. I intend to use my Paramount+ subscription to watch them at some point in the future because, after witnessing Ritchson’s phenomenal portrayal, I am very curious to see how his predecessor, Tom Cruise, measures up.

Child would later admit he agrees with his readers’ opinion that the 5’7” Mission: Impossible movies star, while great at portraying Reacher from an emotional standpoint, might not have been the right choice in terms of his physical appearance. However, Ritchson attempted to reach out to Cruise as a show of respect and gratitude with a letter that, ultimately, never made it to him because, according to Skydance’s Dan Granger, the actor has “moved on.” Well, I still think it would be really cool if Cruise actually provided evidence of his blessing by at least making a small appearance alongside Ritchson on the show, perhaps as someone from Reacher’s past.

If you have never seen Reacher before, but the information and speculation above makes you interested in giving it a try, you might want to get to work on catching yourself up before Season 4 drops. Also, go ahead and give the movies a try if you cannot get enough of Lee Child’s badass hero.

Amazon,Tech employees are getting the message: Play time's over,"A trifecta of economics, pandemic-era realities, and political pressure is changing tech culture.

From Big Tech to Silicon Valley startups, companies are pushing to ""do more with less.""

Leaders aren't shy about wielding their power and aligning around a hard-driving strategy.

For years, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke enjoyed a reputation for growing the $125 billion e-commerce company without working the grueling hours expected of startup founders.

""My job is incredible, but it's also just a job. Family and personal health rank higher in my priority list,"" he wrote in a now-deleted post on X, then Twitter, shortly before the pandemic, as reported by Business Insider at the time. ""The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so.""

This year, even Lütke appeared to change his tune.

""I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend,"" Lütke wrote on X. He was responding to a user who called him a ""counter-example"" to a meme suggesting you can't have work-life balance and a breakthrough startup. ""I don't want people to get misguided by this meme.""

Across tech, the tables have turned for employees as performance pressure and proclamations of ""efficiency"" and ""intensity"" replace perks and pampering. Sweeping layoffs have become the norm in an industry that, in recent memory, enjoyed job security. The pressure to dominate in AI has created intense competition, as companies use the technology to do more with fewer workers. Already hard-driving workplaces have become even harder.

While the situation for tech employees has been changing since the pandemic boom ended in 2022, more recent developments include a decidedly different tone from executives. Now, companies aren't just making these changes; they want to be seen making them.

Elon Musk's slash-and-burn tactics are now being embraced by Silicon Valley in the name of efficiency. At Twitter, Musk cut 80% of the staff — over 6,000 people. Years later, the company didn't collapse as some feared. And now, Musk's outsized influence on President Donald Trump and his administration has empowered both him and his cut throat strategies. CEOs of the biggest tech giants are following suit with similar tactics.

Meta earlier this year said it was cutting 4,000 employees deemed low performers as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the ""culturally neutered"" corporate world had gotten away from ""masculine energy."" Amazon insisted that employees return to the workplace every weekday, a policy some employees say is stricter than before the pandemic.

Other companies have cracked down, too. Microsoft, which was once referred to as a ""country club"" for its relatively lax culture, cut 2,000 employees as it overhauled its review process to eliminate underperformers more quickly.

Google, which practically invented tech perks like free lunch, started an ""efficiency drive."" Its cofounder Sergey Brin, who had stepped away from leading Google but now often shows up to work on the company's Gemini AI models, recently recommended that employees working on its Gemini tools should work 60 hours a week and go into the office ""at least every weekday."" Wall Street has rewarded this rigor, as stock prices of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's parent, Alphabet, have surged since 2022.

Startups also see a trickle-down effect from Big Tech companies' pressures. Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures, said he had noticed a ""pronounced shift"" toward leaner teams and rigorous performance standards at startups.

Between performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, it's clear not only that the tech industry is done coddling employees, but that companies want to send the message those days are over. BI interviewed employees from tech giants, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, as well as various tech startups, about the changes. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity since they're not authorized to talk to the press, though their identities are known to BI.

Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon did not comment. Shopify did not respond to a request for comment.

From comfy to collapsed

For years, fierce competition for tech workers meant companies spoiled employees with astonishing salaries and swanky perks, such as in-office massages and free food cooked by fancy chefs.

By 2022, tech companies seemingly couldn't throw enough money at workers. Early that year, Amazon more than doubled its maximum base salary, and Microsoft gave across-the-board raises to employees up to a certain level of seniority to dissuade them from leaving for competitors.

As the pandemic boom ended, tech stocks plummeted, and interest rates increased through 2022. This prompted an efficiency drive by many companies as investors demanded profitability over growth at all costs.

Also that year, companies watched the billionaire Elon Musk's handling of the Twitter acquisition, in which he cut thousands of employees, plus perks like free lunches, and demanded a commitment to a new ""extremely hardcore"" vision and ""long hours at a high intensity."" At one point, Twitter workers were begging on Slack for toilet paper and clean bathrooms amid Musk's drastic cost-cutting.

As of late last year, Fidelity valued X at only about 20% of the $44 billion that Musk bought it for in 2022. Still, his approach may have expanded what the tech industry thought possible in terms of workforce and cost cutting.

""People paid attention because the prevailing wisdom was you couldn't take out that much of an engineering organization and put that much instability on it and not have it fall over,"" Brad Porter, the founder and CEO of Cobot, told BI. ""It did come close to falling. He pushed right to the edge of it actually falling over, but it didn't fall over.""

'Do more with less'

By the end of 2022 and in early 2023, tech giants had conducted unprecedented rounds of layoffs. Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft collectively laid off more than 60,000 employees during that time.

Layoffs have remained at a steady drip across the industry since. Such cuts have become so frequent at Google, for example, that employees have taken to crowdsourcing information on layoffs in an internal Google Doc.

Employees told BI about the pressure across the industry to ""do more with less."" ""There's lots of uncertainty,"" one longtime Amazon employee said, ""and lots of pressure to perform the jobs of multiple people at the mercy of ruthless middle management.""

Tech companies are also culling middle management layers. Amazon in September announced a plan to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% by the end of this month. In December, CEO Sundar Pichai told his staff that Google had cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of its efficiency drive. Microsoft also monitors what it calls ""span of control,"" tracking the number of reports per manager.

Performance pressures

Amid the cuts, employees across the industry say companies are dialing up the performance demands.

Meta told its staff in January that it would eliminate roughly 5% of its workforce, or about 4,000 employees, to ""raise the bar on performance management,"" as Zuckerberg wrote in an internal memo.

Google also increased pressure on employees. Perhaps most telling was Pichai's December comments attempting to clarify what ""Googleyness"" means for a modern Google. Once a squishy and vague philosophy for the search giant's corporate culture, Pichai said he believed it now meant, among other things, being ""mission first.""

""There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days,"" a longtime Google manager said.

""We're being asked to do more for less,"" said another current longtime Google employee.

That same Google employee said that Silicon Valley had been moving toward more ruthless, efficient workplaces for a while — and that the current political climate ""gives them the green light to do it openly."" Google has been working to become more efficient since its chief investment officer Ruth Porat joined the company as CFO from Morgan Stanley in 2015, ""but now the masks are off,"" the person said.

Microsoft was once referred to as the tech industry's ""country club,"" meaning a place employees would go after they were done working hard in their careers and wanted to coast before retirement. A change this year shows how far Microsoft has shifted when it fired 2,000 employees deemed low performers without severance and ended their health benefits the same day. This kind of performance-based mass cut showed a shift for the tech giant.

One longtime Microsoft senior-level employee said they felt that the ""culture shifts toward firmer performance expectations"" at peer tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon made it more acceptable for Microsoft to do the same.

At TikTok, the pressure to perform jumped last year after the company directed managers to deliver more low scores in performance reviews, leading to PIPs and eventual exits. At the same time, six current and former employees told BI their goals had become much harder to hit. One staffer called the goals ""unattainable.""

The company has also recently heightened RTO requirements for some teams. In February, it told its US e-commerce workers that in addition to being in the office five days a week, they would physically need to be in the building for eight hours a day. Ten current and former workers told BI that burnout had become common, leading to some going on mental health leave to get a break. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.

""You feel like if you're not hitting a target, even if it's a moving target, you're in trouble,"" a former staffer who went on leave for mental health reasons told BI. ""For me, it was just feeling like a failure, like I couldn't do anything right.""

It's gotten hardcore in the 'valley of death'

The increasing pivot to performance has even made it to already hard-charging startups.

Startups have a time-honored tradition of an always-on, work-first lifestyle. Early employees are expected to put in grueling hours of coding and customer support during this critical phase, known as the ""valley of death,"" when startups are flush with initial funding but not yet profitable.

The free-money era tested this tradition of hustle and thriftiness. Investors heaped money into small startups when interest rates bottomed out, and the blitz scaling that followed set off an arms race of perks to help startups attract top talent. Employees could work from home and set their own schedules. They pocketed wellness stipends and trotted the globe on extravagant off-sites. The tech startup Bolt gave many employees Fridays off.

""I think many individuals — founders included — lost sight of the true goal of a company. It is to make money,"" Mang-Git Ng, the founder of Anvil, a paperwork automation company, told BI.

Now, the executives who had lavished high salaries and fancy perks on their employees are resetting expectations, winding down remote work, and cutting head count.

""Everyone who comes into our office at Decagon has opted into working with a team that's here because we want to do big things and see bigger and better results,"" said Jesse Zhang, the founder of Decagon, who now badges into the office six days a week. ""There's no such thing as a rocketship that doesn't have a certain level of intensity to fuel its trajectory.""

Call it the Big Tech trickle-down effect.

""Founders aren't sugarcoating it,"" said Natan Fisher, who runs a recruiting firm, SingleSprout, that specializes in hiring technical talent. ""I've had a few cofounders tell employees they aren't working hard enough, and, 'If you're not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can't slow down.' Late nights, weekends, even people crashing at the office, it's real.""

Shopify did not respond to a request for comment. From comfy to collapsed For years, fierce competition for tech workers meant companies spoiled employees with astonishing salaries and swanky perks, such as in-office massages and free food cooked by fancy chefs. By 2022, tech companies seemingly couldn't throw enough money at workers. Early that year, Amazon more than doubled its maximum base salary, and Microsoft gave across-the-board raises to employees up to a certain level of seniority to dissuade them from leaving for competitors. As the pandemic boom ended, tech stocks plummeted, and interest rates increased through 2022. This prompted an efficiency drive by many companies as investors demanded profitability over growth at all costs. Also that year, companies watched the billionaire Elon Musk's handling of the Twitter acquisition, in which he cut thousands of employees, plus perks like free lunches, and demanded a commitment to a new ""extremely hardcore"" vision and ""long hours at a high intensity."" At one point, Twitter workers were begging on Slack for toilet paper and clean bathrooms amid Musk's drastic cost-cutting. As of late last year, Fidelity valued X at only about 20% of the $44 billion that Musk bought it for in 2022. Still, his approach may have expanded what the tech industry thought possible in terms of workforce and cost cutting. ""People paid attention because the prevailing wisdom was you couldn't take out that much of an engineering organization and put that much instability on it and not have it fall over,"" Brad Porter, the founder and CEO of Cobot, told BI. ""It did come close to falling. He pushed right to the edge of it actually falling over, but it didn't fall over."" 'Do more with less' By the end of 2022 and in early 2023, tech giants had conducted unprecedented rounds of layoffs. Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft collectively laid off more than 60,000 employees during that time. Layoffs have remained at a steady drip across the industry since. Such cuts have become so frequent at Google, for example, that employees have taken to crowdsourcing information on layoffs in an internal Google Doc. Employees told BI about the pressure across the industry to ""do more with less."" ""There's lots of uncertainty,"" one longtime Amazon employee said, ""and lots of pressure to perform the jobs of multiple people at the mercy of ruthless middle management."" Tech companies are also culling middle management layers. Amazon in September announced a plan to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% by the end of this month. In December, CEO Sundar Pichai told his staff that Google had cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of its efficiency drive. Microsoft also monitors what it calls ""span of control,"" tracking the number of reports per manager. Related stories Performance pressures Amid the cuts, employees across the industry say companies are dialing up the performance demands. Meta told its staff in January that it would eliminate roughly 5% of its workforce, or about 4,000 employees, to ""raise the bar on performance management,"" as Zuckerberg wrote in an internal memo. Google also increased pressure on employees. Perhaps most telling was Pichai's December comments attempting to clarify what ""Googleyness"" means for a modern Google. Once a squishy and vague philosophy for the search giant's corporate culture, Pichai said he believed it now meant, among other things, being ""mission first."" ""There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days,"" a longtime Google manager said. ""We're being asked to do more for less,"" said another current longtime Google employee. That same Google employee said that Silicon Valley had been moving toward more ruthless, efficient workplaces for a while — and that the current political climate ""gives them the green light to do it openly."" Google has been working to become more efficient since its chief investment officer Ruth Porat joined the company as CFO from Morgan Stanley in 2015, ""but now the masks are off,"" the person said. Microsoft was once referred to as the tech industry's ""country club,"" meaning a place employees would go after they were done working hard in their careers and wanted to coast before retirement. A change this year shows how far Microsoft has shifted when it fired 2,000 employees deemed low performers without severance and ended their health benefits the same day. This kind of performance-based mass cut showed a shift for the tech giant. One longtime Microsoft senior-level employee said they felt that the ""culture shifts toward firmer performance expectations"" at peer tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon made it more acceptable for Microsoft to do the same. At TikTok, the pressure to perform jumped last year after the company directed managers to deliver more low scores in performance reviews, leading to PIPs and eventual exits. At the same time, six current and former employees told BI their goals had become much harder to hit. One staffer called the goals ""unattainable."" The company has also recently heightened RTO requirements for some teams. In February, it told its US e-commerce workers that in addition to being in the office five days a week, they would physically need to be in the building for eight hours a day. Ten current and former workers told BI that burnout had become common, leading to some going on mental health leave to get a break. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. ""You feel like if you're not hitting a target, even if it's a moving target, you're in trouble,"" a former staffer who went on leave for mental health reasons told BI. ""For me, it was just feeling like a failure, like I couldn't do anything right."" It's gotten hardcore in the 'valley of death' The increasing pivot to performance has even made it to already hard-charging startups. Startups have a time-honored tradition of an always-on, work-first lifestyle. Early employees are expected to put in grueling hours of coding and customer support during this critical phase, known as the ""valley of death,"" when startups are flush with initial funding but not yet profitable. The free-money era tested this tradition of hustle and thriftiness. Investors heaped money into small startups when interest rates bottomed out, and the blitz scaling that followed set off an arms race of perks to help startups attract top talent. Employees could work from home and set their own schedules. They pocketed wellness stipends and trotted the globe on extravagant off-sites. The tech startup Bolt gave many employees Fridays off. ""I think many individuals — founders included — lost sight of the true goal of a company. It is to make money,"" Mang-Git Ng, the founder of Anvil, a paperwork automation company, told BI. Now, the executives who had lavished high salaries and fancy perks on their employees are resetting expectations, winding down remote work, and cutting head count. ""Everyone who comes into our office at Decagon has opted into working with a team that's here because we want to do big things and see bigger and better results,"" said Jesse Zhang, the founder of Decagon, who now badges into the office six days a week. ""There's no such thing as a rocketship that doesn't have a certain level of intensity to fuel its trajectory."" Call it the Big Tech trickle-down effect. ""Founders aren't sugarcoating it,"" said Natan Fisher, who runs a recruiting firm, SingleSprout, that specializes in hiring technical talent. ""I've had a few cofounders tell employees they aren't working hard enough, and, 'If you're not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can't slow down.'

Amazon,Article: Beyond Trends: A Practical Guide to Choosing the Right Message Broker,"Key Takeaways Message brokers can be broadly categorized as either stream-based or queue-based, each offering unique strengths and trade-offs.

Messages in a stream are managed using offsets, allowing consumers to efficiently commit large batches in a single network call and replay messages by rewinding the offset. In contrast, queues have limited batching support and typically do not allow message replay, as messages are removed once consumed.

Streams rely on rigid physical partitions for scaling, which creates challenges in handling poison pills and limits their ability to dynamically auto-scale consumers with fluctuating traffic. Queues, such as Amazon SQS and FIFO SQS, use low-cardinality logical partitions (that are ordered), enabling seamless auto-scaling and effective isolation of poison pills.

Streams are ideal for data replication scenarios because they enable efficient batching and are generally less susceptible to poison pills.

When batch replication is not required, queues like Amazon SQS or FIFO SQS are often the better choice, as they support auto-scaling, isolate poison pills, and provide FIFO ordering when needed.

Combining streams and queues allows organizations to standardize on a single stream solution for producing messages while giving consumers the flexibility to either consume directly from the stream or route messages to a queue based on the messaging pattern.

Messaging solutions play a vital role in modern distributed systems. They enable reliable communication, support asynchronous processing, and provide loose coupling between components. Additionally, they improve application availability and help protect systems from traffic spikes. The available options range from stream-based to queue-based services, each offering unique strengths and trade-offs.



In my experience working with various engineering teams, selecting a message broker is not generally approached with a clear methodology. Decisions are often influenced by trends, personal preference, or the ease of access to a particular technology; rather than the specific needs of an application. However, selecting the right broker should focus on aligning its key characteristics with the application’s requirements - this is the central focus of this article.



We will examine two of the most popular messaging solutions: Apache Kafka (stream-based) and Amazon SQS (queue-based), which are also the main message brokers we use at EarnIn. By discussing how their characteristics align (or don’t) with common messaging patterns, this article aims to provide insights that will help you make more informed decisions. With this understanding, you’ll be better equipped to evaluate other messaging scenarios and brokers, ultimately choosing the one that best suits your application’s needs.

Message Brokers

In this section, we will examine popular message brokers and compare their key characteristics. By understanding these differences, we can evaluate which brokers are best suited for common messaging patterns in modern applications. While this article does not provide an in-depth description of each broker, readers unfamiliar with these technologies are encouraged to refer to their official documentation for more detailed information.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)

Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queue service that simplifies communication between decoupled components in distributed systems. It ensures reliable message delivery while abstracting complexities such as infrastructure management, scalability, and error handling. Below are some of the key properties of Amazon SQS.

Related Sponsored Content

Message Lifecycle Management: In SQS, the message lifecycle is managed either individually or in small batches of up to 10 messages. Each message can be received, processed, deleted, or even delayed based on the application's needs. Typically, an application receives a message, processes it, and then deletes it from the queue, which ensures that messages are reliably processed.

Best-effort Ordering: Standard SQS queues deliver messages in the order they were sent but do not guarantee strict ordering, particularly during retries or parallel consumption. This allows for higher throughput when strict message order isn't necessary. For use cases that require strict ordering, FIFO SQS (First-In-First-Out) can be used to ensure that messages are processed in a certain order (more on FIFO SQS below).

Built-in Dead Letter Queue (DLQ): SQS includes built-in support for Dead Letter Queues (DLQs), which help isolate unprocessable messages.

Write and Read Throughput: SQS supports effectively unlimited read and write throughput, which makes it well-suited for high-volume applications where the ability to handle large message traffic efficiently is essential.

Autoscaling Consumers: SQS supports auto-scaling compute resources (such as AWS Lambda, EC2, or ECS services) based on the number of messages in the queue (see official documentation). Consumers can dynamically scale to handle increased traffic and scale back down when the load decreases. This auto-scaling capability ensures that applications can process varying workloads without manual intervention, which is invaluable for managing unpredictable traffic patterns.

Pub-Sub Support: SQS does not natively support pub-sub, as it is designed for point-to-point messaging where each message is consumed by a single receiver. However, you can achieve a pub-sub architecture by integrating SQS with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). SNS allows messages to be published to a topic, which can then fan out to multiple SQS queues subscribed to that topic. This enables multiple consumers to receive and process the same message independently, effectively implementing a pub-sub system using AWS services.

Amazon FIFO SQS

FIFO SQS extends the capabilities of Standard SQS by guaranteeing strict message ordering within logical partitions called message groups. It is ideal for workflows that require the sequential processing of related events, such as user-specific notifications, financial transactions, or any scenario where maintaining the exact order of messages is crucial. Below are some of the key properties of FIFO SQS.

Message Grouping as Logical Partitions: In FIFO SQS, each message has a MessageGroupId, which is used to define logical partitions within the queue. A message group allows messages that share the same MessageGroupId to be processed sequentially. This ensures that the order of messages within a particular group is strictly maintained, while messages belonging to different message groups can be processed in parallel by different consumers. For example, imagine a scenario where each user’s messages need to be processed in order (e.g., a sequence of notifications or actions triggered by a user).

By assigning each user a unique MessageGroupId, SQS ensures that all messages related to a specific user are processed sequentially, regardless of when the messages are added to the queue. Messages from other users (with different MessageGroupIds) can be processed in parallel, maintaining efficient throughput without affecting the order for any individual user. This is a major benefit for FIFO SQS in comparison to standard SQS or stream based message brokers such as Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis.

Dead Letter Queue (DLQ): FIFO SQS provides built-in support for Dead Letter Queues (DLQs), but their use requires careful consideration as they can disrupt the strict ordering of messages within a message group. For example, if two messages - message1 and message2 - belong to the same MessageGroupId (e.g., groupA ), and message1 fails and is moved to the DLQ, message2 could still be successfully processed. This breaks the intended message order within the group, defeating the primary purpose of FIFO processing.

Poison Pills Isolation: When a DLQ is not used, FIFO SQS will continue retrying the delivery of a failed message indefinitely. While this ensures strict message ordering, it can also create a bottleneck, blocking the processing of all subsequent messages within the same message group until the failed message is successfully processed or deleted.

Messages that repeatedly fail to process are known as poison pills. In some messaging systems, poison pills can block an entire queue or shard, preventing any subsequent messages from being processed. However, in FIFO SQS, the impact is limited to the specific message group (logical partition) the message belongs to. This isolation significantly mitigates broader failures, provided message groups are thoughtfully designed.

To minimize disruption, it’s crucial to choose the MessageGroupId in a way that keeps logical partitions small while ensuring that ordered messages remain within the same partition. For example, in a multi-user application, using a user ID as the MessageGroupId ensures that failures only affect that specific user’s messages. Similarly, in an e-commerce application, using an order ID as the MessageGroupId ensures that a failed order message does not impact orders from other customers.

To illustrate the impact of this isolation, consider a poison pill scenario:

Without isolation (or shard-level isolation), a poison pill could block all orders in an entire region (e.g., all Amazon.com orders in a country).

With FIFO SQS isolation, only a single user’s order would be affected, while others continue processing as expected.

Thus, poison pill isolation is a highly impactful feature of FIFO SQS, significantly improving fault tolerance in distributed messaging systems.

Throughput: FIFO SQS has a default throughput limit of 300 messages per second. However, by enabling high-throughput mode, this can be increased to 9,000 messages per second. Achieving this high throughput requires careful design of message groups to ensure sufficient parallelism.

Autoscaling Consumers: Similar to Standard SQS, FIFO SQS supports auto-scaling compute resources based on the number of messages in the queue. While FIFO SQS scalability is not truly unlimited, it is influenced by the number of message groups (logical partitions), which can be designed to be very high (e.g. a message group per user).

Pub-Sub Support: Just like with Standard SQS, pub-sub can be achieved by pairing FIFO SQS with SNS, which offers support for FIFO topics.

Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source, distributed streaming platform designed for real-time event streaming and high-throughput applications. Unlike traditional message queues like SQS, Kafka operates as a stream-based platform where messages are consumed based on offsets. In Kafka, consumers track their progress by moving their offset forward (or backward for replay), allowing multiple messages to be committed at once. This offset-based approach is a key distinction between Kafka and traditional message queues, where each message is processed and acknowledged independently. Below are some of Kafka's key properties.

Physical Partitions (shards): Kafka topics are divided into physical partitions (also known as shards) at the time of topic creation. Each partition maintains its own offset and manages message ordering independently. While partitions can be added, this may disrupt ordering and requires careful handling. On the other hand, reducing partitions is even more complex and generally avoided, as it affects data distribution and consumer load balancing. Because partitioning affects scalability and performance, it should be carefully planned from the start.

Pub-Sub Support: Kafka supports a publish-subscribe model natively. This allows multiple consumer groups to independently process the same topic, enabling different applications or services to consume the same data without interfering with each other. Each consumer group gets its own view of the topic, allowing for flexible scaling of both producers and consumers.

High Throughput and Batch Processing: Kafka is optimized for high-throughput use cases, enabling the efficient processing of large volumes of data. Consumers can process large batches of messages, minimizing the number of reads and writes to Kafka. For instance, a consumer can process up to 10,000 messages, save them to a database in a single operation, and then commit the offset in one step, significantly reducing overhead. This is a key differentiator of streams from queues where messages are managed individually or in small batches.

Replay Capability: Kafka retains messages for a configurable retention period (default is 7 days), allowing consumers to rewind and replay messages. This is particularly useful for debugging, reprocessing historical data, or recovering from application errors. Consumers can process data at their own pace and retry messages if necessary, making Kafka an excellent choice for use cases that require durability and fault tolerance.

Handling Poison Pills: In Kafka, poison pills can block the entire physical partition they reside in, delaying the processing of all subsequent messages within that partition. This can have serious consequences on an application. For example, in an e-commerce application where each region's orders are processed through a dedicated Kafka shard, a single poison pill could block all orders for that region, leading to significant business disruptions. This limitation highlights a key drawback of strict physical partitioning compared to logical partitioning available in queues such as FIFO SQS, where failures are isolated within smaller message groups rather than affecting an entire shard.

If strict ordering is not required, using a Dead Letter Queue can help mitigate the impact by isolating poison pills, preventing them from blocking further message processing.

Autoscaling Limitations: Kafka’s scaling is constrained by its partition model, where each shard (partition) maintains strict ordering and can be processed by only one compute node at a time. This means that adding more compute nodes than the number of partitions does not improve throughput, as the extra nodes will remain idle. As a result, Kafka does not pair well with auto-scaling consumers, since the number of active consumers is effectively limited by the number of partitions. This makes Kafka less flexible in dynamic scaling scenarios compared to messaging systems like FIFO SQS, where logical partitioning allows for more granular consumer scaling.

Messaging Patterns and Their Influence on Broker Selection

In distributed systems, messaging patterns define how services communicate and process information. Each pattern comes with unique requirements, such as ordering, scalability, error handling, or parallelism, which guide the selection of an appropriate message broker. This discussion focuses on three common messaging patterns: Command Pattern, Event-Carried State Transfer (ECST), and Event Notification Pattern, and examines how their characteristics align with the capabilities of popular brokers like Amazon SQS and Apache Kafka. This framework can also be applied to evaluate other messaging patterns and determine the best-fit message broker for specific use cases.

The Command Pattern

The Command Pattern is a design approach where requests or actions are encapsulated as standalone command objects. These commands are sent to a message broker for asynchronous processing, allowing the sender to continue operating without waiting for a response.

This pattern enhances reliability, as commands can be persisted and retried upon failure. It also improves the availability of the producer, enabling it to operate even when consumers are unavailable. Additionally, it helps protect consumers from traffic spikes, as they can process commands at their own pace.

Since command processing often involves complex business logic, database operations, and API calls, successful implementation requires reliability, parallel processing, auto-scaling, and effective handling of poison pills.

Key Characteristics

Multiple Sources, Single Destination: A command can be produced by one or more services but is typically consumed by a single service. Each command is usually processed only once, with multiple consumer nodes competing for commands. As a result, pub/sub support is unnecessary for commands.

High Throughput: Commands may be generated at a high rate by multiple producers, requiring the selected message broker to support high throughput with low latency. This ensures that producing commands does not become a bottleneck for upstream services.

Autoscaling Consumers: On the consumer side, command processing often involves time-consuming tasks such as database writes and external API calls. To prevent contention, parallel processing of commands is essential. The selected message broker should enable consumers to retrieve commands in parallel and process them independently, without being constrained by a small number of parallel workstreams (such as physical partitions). This allows for horizontal scaling to handle fluctuations in command throughput, ensuring the system can meet peak demands by adding consumers and scale back during low activity periods to optimize resource usage.

Risk of Poison Pills: Command processing often involves complex workflows and network calls, increasing the likelihood of failures that can result in poison pills. To mitigate this, the message broker must support high cardinality poison pill isolation, ensuring that failed messages affect only a small subset of commands rather than disrupting the entire system. By isolating poison pills within distinct message groups or partitions, the system can maintain reliability and continue processing unaffected commands efficiently.

Broker Alignment

Given the requirements for parallel consumption, autoscaling, and poison pill isolation, Kafka is not well-suited for processing commands. As previously discussed, Kafka’s rigid number of physical partitions cannot be scaled dynamically. Furthermore, a poison pill can block an entire physical partition, potentially disrupting a large number of the application's users.

If ordering is not a requirement, standard SQS is an excellent choice for consuming and processing commands. It supports parallel consumption with unlimited throughput, dynamic scaling, and the ability to isolate poison pills using a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).

For scenarios where ordering is required and can be distributed across multiple logical partitions, FIFO SQS is the ideal solution. By strategically selecting the message group ID to create numerous small logical partitions, the system can achieve near-unlimited parallelism and throughput. Moreover, any poison pill will only affect a single logical partition (e.g., one user of the application), ensuring that its impact is isolated and minimal.

Event-carried State Transfer (ECST)

The Event-Carried State Transfer (ECST) pattern is a design approach used in distributed systems to enable data replication and decentralized processing. In this pattern, events act as the primary mechanism for transferring state changes between services or systems. Each event includes all the necessary information (state) required for other components to update their local state without relying on synchronous calls to the originating service.

By decoupling services and reducing the need for real-time communication, ECST enhances system resilience, allowing components to operate independently even when parts of the system are temporarily unavailable. Additionally, ECST alleviates the load on the source system by replicating data to where it is needed. Services can rely on their local state copies rather than making repeated API calls to the source. This pattern is particularly useful in event-driven architectures and scenarios where eventual consistency is acceptable.

Key Characteristics

Single Source, Multiple Destinations: In ECST, events are published by the owner of the state and consumed by multiple domains or services interested in replicating the state. This requires a message broker that supports the publish-subscribe (pub-sub) pattern.

Low Likelihood of Poison Pills: Since ECST involves minimal business logic and typically avoids API calls to other services, the risk of poison pills is negligible. As a result, the use of a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) is generally unnecessary in this pattern.

Batch Processing: As a data-replication pattern, ECST benefits significantly from batch processing. Replicating data in large batches improves performance and reduces costs, especially when the target database supports bulk inserts in a single operation. A message broker that supports efficient large-batch commits, combined with a database optimized for batching, can dramatically enhance application performance.

Strict Ordering: Strict message ordering is often essential in ECST to ensure that the state of a domain entity is replicated in the correct sequence. This prevents older versions of an entity from overwriting newer ones. Ordering is particularly critical when events carry deltas (e.g., ""set property X""), as out-of-order events cannot simply be discarded. A message broker that supports strict ordering can greatly simplify event consumption and ensure data integrity.

Broker Alignment

Given the requirements for pub-sub, strict ordering, and batch processing, along with the low likelihood of poison pills, Apache Kafka is a great fit for the ECST pattern.

Kafka allows consumers to process large batches of messages and commit offsets in a single operation. For example, 10,000 events can be processed, written to the database in a single batch (assuming the database supports it), and committed with one network call, making Kafka significantly more efficient than Amazon SQS in such scenarios. Furthermore, the minimal risk of poison pills eliminates the need for DLQs, simplifying error handling. In addition to its batching capabilities, Kafka’s partitioning mechanism enables increased throughput by distributing events across multiple shards.

However, if the target database does not support batching, writing data to the database may become the bottleneck, rendering Kafka's batch-commit advantage less relevant. For such scenarios, funneling messages from Kafka into FIFO SQS or using FIFO SNS/SQS without Kafka can be more effective. As discussed earlier, FIFO SQS allows for fine-grained logical partitions, enabling parallel processing while maintaining message order. This design supports dynamic scaling by increasing the number of consumer nodes to handle traffic spikes, ensuring efficient processing even under heavy workloads.

Event Notification Pattern

The Event Notification Pattern enables services to notify other services of significant events occurring within a system. Notifications are lightweight and typically include just enough information (e.g., an identifier) to describe the event. To process a notification, consumers often need to fetch additional details from the source (and/or other services) by making API calls. Furthermore, consumers may need to make database updates, create commands or publish notifications for other systems to consume. This pattern promotes loose coupling and real-time responsiveness in distributed architectures. However, given the potential complexity of processing notifications (e.g. API calls, database updates and publishing events), scalability and robust error handling are essential considerations.

Key Characteristics

The characteristics of the Event Notification Pattern overlap significantly with those of the Command pattern, especially when processing notifications involves complex and time consuming tasks. In these scenarios, implementing this pattern requires support for parallel consumption, autoscaling consumers, and isolation of poison pills to ensure reliable and efficient processing. Moreover, the Event Notification Pattern necessitates PubSub support to facilitate one-to-many distribution of events.

There are cases when processing notifications involve simpler workflows, such as updating a database or publishing events to downstream systems. In such cases, the characteristics of this pattern align more closely with those of the ECST pattern.

It should also be noted that different consumers of the same notification may process notifications differently. It’s possible that one consumer needs to apply complex processing while another is performing very simple tasks that are unlikely to ever fail.

Broker Alignment

When the characteristics of the notifications consumer align with those of consuming commands, SQS (or FIFO SQS) is the obvious choice. However, if a consumer only needs to perform simple database updates, consuming notifications from Kafka may be more efficient because of the ability to process notifications in batches and Kafka’s ability to perform large batch commits.

The challenge with notifications is that it’s not always possible to predict the consumption patterns in advance, which makes it difficult to choose between SNS vs Kafka when producing notifications.

To gain more flexibility, at EarnIn we have decided to use Kafka as the sole broker for publishing notifications. If a consumer requires SQS properties for consumption, it can funnel messages from Kafka to SQS using AWS event bridge. If a consumer doesn’t require SQS properties, it can consume directly from Kafka and benefit from its efficient batching capabilities. Moreover, using Kafka instead of SNS for publishing notifications also provides consumers the ability to leverage Kafka’s replay capability, even when messages are funneled to SQS for consumption.

Furthermore, given that Kafka is also a good fit for the ECST pattern and that the command pattern doesn’t require PubSub, we had no reasons left to use SNS. This allowed us to standardize on Kafka as the sole PubSub broker, which significantly simplifies our workflows. In fact, with all events flowing through Kafka, we were able to build tooling that allowed us to replicate Kafka events to a DataLake, which can be leveraged for debugging, analytics, replay / backfilling and more.

Conclusion

Selecting the right message broker for your application requires understanding the characteristics of the available options and the messaging pattern you are using. Key factors to consider include traffic patterns, auto-scaling capabilities, tolerance to poison pills, batch processing needs, and ordering requirements.

While this article focused on Amazon SQS and Apache Kafka, the broader decision often comes down to choosing between a queue and a stream. However, it is also possible to leverage the strengths of both by combining them.

Standardizing on a single broker for producing events allows your company to focus on building tooling, replication, and observability for one system, reducing maintenance costs. Consumers can then route messages to the appropriate broker for consumption using services like EventBridge, ensuring flexibility while maintaining operational efficiency.","Key Takeaways Message brokers can be broadly categorized as either stream-based or queue-based, each offering unique strengths and trade-offs. Messages in a stream are managed using offsets, allowing consumers to efficiently commit large batches in a single network call and replay messages by rewinding the offset. In contrast, queues have limited batching support and typically do not allow message replay, as messages are removed once consumed. Streams rely on rigid physical partitions for scaling, which creates challenges in handling poison pills and limits their ability to dynamically auto-scale consumers with fluctuating traffic. Queues, such as Amazon SQS and FIFO SQS, use low-cardinality logical partitions (that are ordered), enabling seamless auto-scaling and effective isolation of poison pills. Streams are ideal for data replication scenarios because they enable efficient batching and are generally less susceptible to poison pills. When batch replication is not required, queues like Amazon SQS or FIFO SQS are often the better choice, as they support auto-scaling, isolate poison pills, and provide FIFO ordering when needed. Combining streams and queues allows organizations to standardize on a single stream solution for producing messages while giving consumers the flexibility to either consume directly from the stream or route messages to a queue based on the messaging pattern. Messaging solutions play a vital role in modern distributed systems. They enable reliable communication, support asynchronous processing, and provide loose coupling between components. Additionally, they improve application availability and help protect systems from traffic spikes. The available options range from stream-based to queue-based services, each offering unique strengths and trade-offs. In my experience working with various engineering teams, selecting a message broker is not generally approached with a clear methodology. Decisions are often influenced by trends, personal preference, or the ease of access to a particular technology; rather than the specific needs of an application. However, selecting the right broker should focus on aligning its key characteristics with the application’s requirements - this is the central focus of this article. We will examine two of the most popular messaging solutions: Apache Kafka (stream-based) and Amazon SQS (queue-based), which are also the main message brokers we use at EarnIn. By discussing how their characteristics align (or don’t) with common messaging patterns, this article aims to provide insights that will help you make more informed decisions. With this understanding, you’ll be better equipped to evaluate other messaging scenarios and brokers, ultimately choosing the one that best suits your application’s needs. Message Brokers In this section, we will examine popular message brokers and compare their key characteristics. By understanding these differences, we can evaluate which brokers are best suited for common messaging patterns in modern applications. While this article does not provide an in-depth description of each broker, readers unfamiliar with these technologies are encouraged to refer to their official documentation for more detailed information. Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queue service that simplifies communication between decoupled components in distributed systems. It ensures reliable message delivery while abstracting complexities such as infrastructure management, scalability, and error handling. Below are some of the key properties of Amazon SQS. Related Sponsored Content Message Lifecycle Management: In SQS, the message lifecycle is managed either individually or in small batches of up to 10 messages. Each message can be received, processed, deleted, or even delayed based on the application's needs. Typically, an application receives a message, processes it, and then deletes it from the queue, which ensures that messages are reliably processed. Best-effort Ordering: Standard SQS queues deliver messages in the order they were sent but do not guarantee strict ordering, particularly during retries or parallel consumption. This allows for higher throughput when strict message order isn't necessary. For use cases that require strict ordering, FIFO SQS (First-In-First-Out) can be used to ensure that messages are processed in a certain order (more on FIFO SQS below). Built-in Dead Letter Queue (DLQ): SQS includes built-in support for Dead Letter Queues (DLQs), which help isolate unprocessable messages. Write and Read Throughput: SQS supports effectively unlimited read and write throughput, which makes it well-suited for high-volume applications where the ability to handle large message traffic efficiently is essential. Autoscaling Consumers: SQS supports auto-scaling compute resources (such as AWS Lambda, EC2, or ECS services) based on the number of messages in the queue (see official documentation). Consumers can dynamically scale to handle increased traffic and scale back down when the load decreases. This auto-scaling capability ensures that applications can process varying workloads without manual intervention, which is invaluable for managing unpredictable traffic patterns. Pub-Sub Support: SQS does not natively support pub-sub, as it is designed for point-to-point messaging where each message is consumed by a single receiver. However, you can achieve a pub-sub architecture by integrating SQS with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). SNS allows messages to be published to a topic, which can then fan out to multiple SQS queues subscribed to that topic. This enables multiple consumers to receive and process the same message independently, effectively implementing a pub-sub system using AWS services. Amazon FIFO SQS FIFO SQS extends the capabilities of Standard SQS by guaranteeing strict message ordering within logical partitions called message groups. It is ideal for workflows that require the sequential processing of related events, such as user-specific notifications, financial transactions, or any scenario where maintaining the exact order of messages is crucial. Below are some of the key properties of FIFO SQS. Message Grouping as Logical Partitions: In FIFO SQS, each message has a MessageGroupId, which is used to define logical partitions within the queue. A message group allows messages that share the same MessageGroupId to be processed sequentially. This ensures that the order of messages within a particular group is strictly maintained, while messages belonging to different message groups can be processed in parallel by different consumers. For example, imagine a scenario where each user’s messages need to be processed in order (e.g., a sequence of notifications or actions triggered by a user). By assigning each user a unique MessageGroupId, SQS ensures that all messages related to a specific user are processed sequentially, regardless of when the messages are added to the queue. Messages from other users (with different MessageGroupIds) can be processed in parallel, maintaining efficient throughput without affecting the order for any individual user. This is a major benefit for FIFO SQS in comparison to standard SQS or stream based message brokers such as Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ): FIFO SQS provides built-in support for Dead Letter Queues (DLQs), but their use requires careful consideration as they can disrupt the strict ordering of messages within a message group. For example, if two messages - message1 and message2 - belong to the same MessageGroupId (e.g., groupA ), and message1 fails and is moved to the DLQ, message2 could still be successfully processed. This breaks the intended message order within the group, defeating the primary purpose of FIFO processing. Poison Pills Isolation: When a DLQ is not used, FIFO SQS will continue retrying the delivery of a failed message indefinitely. While this ensures strict message ordering, it can also create a bottleneck, blocking the processing of all subsequent messages within the same message group until the failed message is successfully processed or deleted. Messages that repeatedly fail to process are known as poison pills. In some messaging systems, poison pills can block an entire queue or shard, preventing any subsequent messages from being processed. However, in FIFO SQS, the impact is limited to the specific message group (logical partition) the message belongs to. This isolation significantly mitigates broader failures, provided message groups are thoughtfully designed. To minimize disruption, it’s crucial to choose the MessageGroupId in a way that keeps logical partitions small while ensuring that ordered messages remain within the same partition. For example, in a multi-user application, using a user ID as the MessageGroupId ensures that failures only affect that specific user’s messages. Similarly, in an e-commerce application, using an order ID as the MessageGroupId ensures that a failed order message does not impact orders from other customers. To illustrate the impact of this isolation, consider a poison pill scenario: Without isolation (or shard-level isolation), a poison pill could block all orders in an entire region (e.g., all Amazon.com orders in a country). With FIFO SQS isolation, only a single user’s order would be affected, while others continue processing as expected. Thus, poison pill isolation is a highly impactful feature of FIFO SQS, significantly improving fault tolerance in distributed messaging systems. Throughput: FIFO SQS has a default throughput limit of 300 messages per second. However, by enabling high-throughput mode, this can be increased to 9,000 messages per second. Achieving this high throughput requires careful design of message groups to ensure sufficient parallelism. Autoscaling Consumers: Similar to Standard SQS, FIFO SQS supports auto-scaling compute resources based on the number of messages in the queue. While FIFO SQS scalability is not truly unlimited, it is influenced by the number of message groups (logical partitions), which can be designed to be very high (e.g. a message group per user). Pub-Sub Support: Just like with Standard SQS, pub-sub can be achieved by pairing FIFO SQS with SNS, which offers support for FIFO topics. Apache Kafka Apache Kafka is an open-source, distributed streaming platform designed for real-time event streaming and high-throughput applications. Unlike traditional message queues like SQS, Kafka operates as a stream-based platform where messages are consumed based on offsets. In Kafka, consumers track their progress by moving their offset forward (or backward for replay), allowing multiple messages to be committed at once. This offset-based approach is a key distinction between Kafka and traditional message queues, where each message is processed and acknowledged independently. Below are some of Kafka's key properties. Physical Partitions (shards): Kafka topics are divided into physical partitions (also known as shards) at the time of topic creation. Each partition maintains its own offset and manages message ordering independently. While partitions can be added, this may disrupt ordering and requires careful handling. On the other hand, reducing partitions is even more complex and generally avoided, as it affects data distribution and consumer load balancing. Because partitioning affects scalability and performance, it should be carefully planned from the start. Pub-Sub Support: Kafka supports a publish-subscribe model natively. This allows multiple consumer groups to independently process the same topic, enabling different applications or services to consume the same data without interfering with each other. Each consumer group gets its own view of the topic, allowing for flexible scaling of both producers and consumers. High Throughput and Batch Processing: Kafka is optimized for high-throughput use cases, enabling the efficient processing of large volumes of data. Consumers can process large batches of messages, minimizing the number of reads and writes to Kafka. For instance, a consumer can process up to 10,000 messages, save them to a database in a single operation, and then commit the offset in one step, significantly reducing overhead. This is a key differentiator of streams from queues where messages are managed individually or in small batches. Replay Capability: Kafka retains messages for a configurable retention period (default is 7 days), allowing consumers to rewind and replay messages. This is particularly useful for debugging, reprocessing historical data, or recovering from application errors. Consumers can process data at their own pace and retry messages if necessary, making Kafka an excellent choice for use cases that require durability and fault tolerance. Handling Poison Pills: In Kafka, poison pills can block the entire physical partition they reside in, delaying the processing of all subsequent messages within that partition. This can have serious consequences on an application. For example, in an e-commerce application where each region's orders are processed through a dedicated Kafka shard, a single poison pill could block all orders for that region, leading to significant business disruptions. This limitation highlights a key drawback of strict physical partitioning compared to logical partitioning available in queues such as FIFO SQS, where failures are isolated within smaller message groups rather than affecting an entire shard. If strict ordering is not required, using a Dead Letter Queue can help mitigate the impact by isolating poison pills, preventing them from blocking further message processing. Autoscaling Limitations: Kafka’s scaling is constrained by its partition model, where each shard (partition) maintains strict ordering and can be processed by only one compute node at a time. This means that adding more compute nodes than the number of partitions does not improve throughput, as the extra nodes will remain idle. As a result, Kafka does not pair well with auto-scaling consumers, since the number of active consumers is effectively limited by the number of partitions. This makes Kafka less flexible in dynamic scaling scenarios compared to messaging systems like FIFO SQS, where logical partitioning allows for more granular consumer scaling. Comparison of Messaging Brokers Feature Standard SQS FIFO SQS Apache Kafka Message Retention Up to 14 days Up to 14 days Configurable (default: 7 days) Pub-Sub Support via SNS via SNS Native via consumer groups Message Ordering Best-effort ordering Guaranteed within a message group Guaranteed within a physical partition (shard) Batch Processing Supports batches of up to 10 messages Supports batches of up to 10 messages Efficient large-batch commits Write Throughput Effectively unlimited 300 messages/second per message group Scalable via physical partitions (millions of messages/second achievable) Read Throughput Unlimited 300 messages/second per message group Scalable via physical partitions (millions of messages/second achievable) DLQ Support Built-in Built-in but can disrupt ordering Supported via connectors but can disrupt ordering of a physical partition Poison Pill Isolation Isolated to individual messages Isolated to message groups Can block an entire physical partition Replay Capability Not supported Not supported Supported with offset rewinding Autoscaling Consumers Unlimited Limited by the number of message groups (i.e. nearly unlimited in practice) Limited by the number of physical partitions (shards) Messaging Patterns and Their Influence on Broker Selection In distributed systems, messaging patterns define how services communicate and process information. Each pattern comes with unique requirements, such as ordering, scalability, error handling, or parallelism, which guide the selection of an appropriate message broker. This discussion focuses on three common messaging patterns: Command Pattern, Event-Carried State Transfer (ECST), and Event Notification Pattern, and examines how their characteristics align with the capabilities of popular brokers like Amazon SQS and Apache Kafka. This framework can also be applied to evaluate other messaging patterns and determine the best-fit message broker for specific use cases. The Command Pattern The Command Pattern is a design approach where requests or actions are encapsulated as standalone command objects. These commands are sent to a message broker for asynchronous processing, allowing the sender to continue operating without waiting for a response. This pattern enhances reliability, as commands can be persisted and retried upon failure. It also improves the availability of the producer, enabling it to operate even when consumers are unavailable. Additionally, it helps protect consumers from traffic spikes, as they can process commands at their own pace. Since command processing often involves complex business logic, database operations, and API calls, successful implementation requires reliability, parallel processing, auto-scaling, and effective handling of poison pills. Key Characteristics Multiple Sources, Single Destination: A command can be produced by one or more services but is typically consumed by a single service. Each command is usually processed only once, with multiple consumer nodes competing for commands. As a result, pub/sub support is unnecessary for commands. High Throughput: Commands may be generated at a high rate by multiple producers, requiring the selected message broker to support high throughput with low latency. This ensures that producing commands does not become a bottleneck for upstream services. Autoscaling Consumers: On the consumer side, command processing often involves time-consuming tasks such as database writes and external API calls. To prevent contention, parallel processing of commands is essential. The selected message broker should enable consumers to retrieve commands in parallel and process them independently, without being constrained by a small number of parallel workstreams (such as physical partitions). This allows for horizontal scaling to handle fluctuations in command throughput, ensuring the system can meet peak demands by adding consumers and scale back during low activity periods to optimize resource usage. Risk of Poison Pills: Command processing often involves complex workflows and network calls, increasing the likelihood of failures that can result in poison pills. To mitigate this, the message broker must support high cardinality poison pill isolation, ensuring that failed messages affect only a small subset of commands rather than disrupting the entire system. By isolating poison pills within distinct message groups or partitions, the system can maintain reliability and continue processing unaffected commands efficiently. Broker Alignment Given the requirements for parallel consumption, autoscaling, and poison pill isolation, Kafka is not well-suited for processing commands. As previously discussed, Kafka’s rigid number of physical partitions cannot be scaled dynamically. Furthermore, a poison pill can block an entire physical partition, potentially disrupting a large number of the application's users. If ordering is not a requirement, standard SQS is an excellent choice for consuming and processing commands. It supports parallel consumption with unlimited throughput, dynamic scaling, and the ability to isolate poison pills using a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). For scenarios where ordering is required and can be distributed across multiple logical partitions, FIFO SQS is the ideal solution. By strategically selecting the message group ID to create numerous small logical partitions, the system can achieve near-unlimited parallelism and throughput. Moreover, any poison pill will only affect a single logical partition (e.g., one user of the application), ensuring that its impact is isolated and minimal. Event-carried State Transfer (ECST) The Event-Carried State Transfer (ECST) pattern is a design approach used in distributed systems to enable data replication and decentralized processing. In this pattern, events act as the primary mechanism for transferring state changes between services or systems. Each event includes all the necessary information (state) required for other components to update their local state without relying on synchronous calls to the originating service. By decoupling services and reducing the need for real-time communication, ECST enhances system resilience, allowing components to operate independently even when parts of the system are temporarily unavailable. Additionally, ECST alleviates the load on the source system by replicating data to where it is needed. Services can rely on their local state copies rather than making repeated API calls to the source. This pattern is particularly useful in event-driven architectures and scenarios where eventual consistency is acceptable. Key Characteristics Single Source, Multiple Destinations: In ECST, events are published by the owner of the state and consumed by multiple domains or services interested in replicating the state. This requires a message broker that supports the publish-subscribe (pub-sub) pattern. Low Likelihood of Poison Pills: Since ECST involves minimal business logic and typically avoids API calls to other services, the risk of poison pills is negligible. As a result, the use of a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) is generally unnecessary in this pattern. Batch Processing: As a data-replication pattern, ECST benefits significantly from batch processing. Replicating data in large batches improves performance and reduces costs, especially when the target database supports bulk inserts in a single operation. A message broker that supports efficient large-batch commits, combined with a database optimized for batching, can dramatically enhance application performance. Strict Ordering: Strict message ordering is often essential in ECST to ensure that the state of a domain entity is replicated in the correct sequence. This prevents older versions of an entity from overwriting newer ones. Ordering is particularly critical when events carry deltas (e.g., ""set property X""), as out-of-order events cannot simply be discarded. A message broker that supports strict ordering can greatly simplify event consumption and ensure data integrity. Broker Alignment Given the requirements for pub-sub, strict ordering, and batch processing, along with the low likelihood of poison pills, Apache Kafka is a great fit for the ECST pattern. Kafka allows consumers to process large batches of messages and commit offsets in a single operation. For example, 10,000 events can be processed, written to the database in a single batch (assuming the database supports it), and committed with one network call, making Kafka significantly more efficient than Amazon SQS in such scenarios. Furthermore, the minimal risk of poison pills eliminates the need for DLQs, simplifying error handling. In addition to its batching capabilities, Kafka’s partitioning mechanism enables increased throughput by distributing events across multiple shards. However, if the target database does not support batching, writing data to the database may become the bottleneck, rendering Kafka's batch-commit advantage less relevant. For such scenarios, funneling messages from Kafka into FIFO SQS or using FIFO SNS/SQS without Kafka can be more effective. As discussed earlier, FIFO SQS allows for fine-grained logical partitions, enabling parallel processing while maintaining message order. This design supports dynamic scaling by increasing the number of consumer nodes to handle traffic spikes, ensuring efficient processing even under heavy workloads. Event Notification Pattern The Event Notification Pattern enables services to notify other services of significant events occurring within a system. Notifications are lightweight and typically include just enough information (e.g., an identifier) to describe the event. To process a notification, consumers often need to fetch additional details from the source (and/or other services) by making API calls. Furthermore, consumers may need to make database updates, create commands or publish notifications for other systems to consume. This pattern promotes loose coupling and real-time responsiveness in distributed architectures. However, given the potential complexity of processing notifications (e.g. API calls, database updates and publishing events), scalability and robust error handling are essential considerations. Key Characteristics The characteristics of the Event Notification Pattern overlap significantly with those of the Command pattern, especially when processing notifications involves complex and time consuming tasks. In these scenarios, implementing this pattern requires support for parallel consumption, autoscaling consumers, and isolation of poison pills to ensure reliable and efficient processing. Moreover, the Event Notification Pattern necessitates PubSub support to facilitate one-to-many distribution of events. There are cases when processing notifications involve simpler workflows, such as updating a database or publishing events to downstream systems. In such cases, the characteristics of this pattern align more closely with those of the ECST pattern. It should also be noted that different consumers of the same notification may process notifications differently. It’s possible that one consumer needs to apply complex processing while another is performing very simple tasks that are unlikely to ever fail. Broker Alignment When the characteristics of the notifications consumer align with those of consuming commands, SQS (or FIFO SQS) is the obvious choice. However, if a consumer only needs to perform simple database updates, consuming notifications from Kafka may be more efficient because of the ability to process notifications in batches and Kafka’s ability to perform large batch commits. The challenge with notifications is that it’s not always possible to predict the consumption patterns in advance, which makes it difficult to choose between SNS vs Kafka when producing notifications. To gain more flexibility, at EarnIn we have decided to use Kafka as the sole broker for publishing notifications. If a consumer requires SQS properties for consumption, it can funnel messages from Kafka to SQS using AWS event bridge. If a consumer doesn’t require SQS properties, it can consume directly from Kafka and benefit from its efficient batching capabilities. Moreover, using Kafka instead of SNS for publishing notifications also provides consumers the ability to leverage Kafka’s replay capability, even when messages are funneled to SQS for consumption. Furthermore, given that Kafka is also a good fit for the ECST pattern and that the command pattern doesn’t require PubSub, we had no reasons left to use SNS. This allowed us to standardize on Kafka as the sole PubSub broker, which significantly simplifies our workflows. In fact, with all events flowing through Kafka, we were able to build tooling that allowed us to replicate Kafka events to a DataLake, which can be leveraged for debugging, analytics, replay / backfilling and more.

Amazon,The Silent Bestseller: How Some Self-Published Books Thrive Without Viral Marketing,"Photo by MIGUEL GASCOJ on Unsplash

Today’s post is by author Janee’ Butterfield.

We all hear stories about the books that take off overnight, becoming instant bestsellers thanks to a viral TikTok trend or an influencer’s endorsement. But what about the books that don’t explode right away—those that quietly gain traction, slowly building an audience over time?

That’s the path I’ve experienced firsthand. As the indie author of three suspense-thriller novels—Caught in Cryptic, Falling Cryptic, and Nighty Night, Dear—I’ve come to appreciate the long game. Some books don’t need a viral moment; they just need the right readers to find them. And sometimes, that takes patience.

The power of a second (or third) book

When I released Caught in Cryptic, I poured everything into marketing it, hoping for an immediate surge in sales. I ran Amazon ads, posted across social media, and told every friend and family member about my debut. Sales came in, but not at the level I had dreamed of.

At first, I felt frustrated. Had I done something wrong? Was my book just lost in the sea of self-published novels? Then, I published Falling Cryptic, and something unexpected happened—readers who discovered my second book went back and bought my first. By the time Nighty Night, Dear was out, I had an actual readership—people waiting for my next book.

One book is an introduction, but multiple books create momentum. Even if your first release doesn’t gain traction immediately, don’t give up. Keep writing. Each new book is another opportunity for someone to discover your work.

Why placement matters more than you think

When I first listed Caught in Cryptic on Amazon, I categorized it under “Thrillers & Suspense.” That seemed like the logical choice—after all, my book is a thriller. But I quickly realized that broad categories meant fierce competition. My book was buried under thousands of others, struggling to get noticed.

For my second book, I took a different approach. I placed Falling Cryptic in “Psychological Thrillers”, a more focused niche where it had a better chance of ranking. Almost immediately, I saw a difference. The book appeared in Amazon’s “Also Bought” recommendations alongside similar thrillers, and sales gradually picked up.

A book’s success isn’t just about how well it’s written. It’s also about where it lives online. The right category can make a world of difference, and making small adjustments to metadata, keywords, and book descriptions can help your book reach its ideal audience.

Amazon’s free promotions: a game changer

One of the most underrated marketing tools for self-published authors is Amazon’s free promotion days for Kindle books. I was hesitant at first. Why would I give away my book for free when I had worked so hard on it? But after hearing from other indie authors about the impact, I decided to try it.

When I ran a free promo for Caught in Cryptic, something unexpected happened—a friend of mine decided to host a book club discussion about it. She invited a mix of avid thriller readers and casual book lovers. That one small event sparked conversations, led to new reviews, and even brought in sales for my other books.

Giving away books for free might seem counterproductive, but it’s one of the best ways to get readers invested. Once they finish one book, they’re more likely to purchase another. More importantly, it helps trigger Amazon’s algorithms, increasing a book’s visibility long after the free period ends.

Engaging readers beyond the pages

At first, I thought marketing meant constantly running ads or posting daily on social media. But the most effective strategy I’ve found is much more personal: engaging with readers beyond the book itself.

Before finalizing Falling Cryptic, I emailed my newsletter subscribers, asking for help brainstorming book club discussion questions. I wasn’t sure how many responses I’d get, but I was amazed at the level of engagement. Readers shared thoughtful insights, and some even pointed out details I hadn’t fully considered myself. That back-and-forth made them feel personally invested in my book—and when it launched, they were excited to share it with others.

This experience made me realize something important: readers don’t just want to consume stories—they want to be part of the experience. Whether it’s helping pick a character’s name, voting on cover designs, or joining an exclusive reader group, small interactions create a loyal fanbase that keeps coming back.

The importance of early reviews

Reviews are one of the biggest challenges for indie authors. Even readers who love your book don’t always remember to leave one. But without reviews, books struggle to gain traction.

To fix this, I started using BookSprout, a platform where authors can offer free review copies in exchange for honest feedback. This helped me build momentum early on, ensuring my books had reviews on launch day rather than waiting months for them to trickle in. Other strategies that worked for me:

Sending ARCs (advance reader copies) to my newsletter subscribers

Connecting with book bloggers who focus on indie authors

Engaging with Goodreads communities that love my genre

These efforts made a real difference. Reviews not only help with credibility, but they also increase your chances of being featured in Amazon’s recommendation engine, leading to more organic sales.

Patience: the hardest but most important part

If I could go back and give my past self advice, it would be this: don’t obsess over overnight success.

I spent months wondering why my first book wasn’t taking off as fast as I wanted. What I didn’t realize was that some books take time.

I remember the moment that changed my mindset—I got a message from a reader who had picked up Caught in Cryptic months after its release. She told me she couldn’t stop thinking about it and immediately bought Falling Cryptic. That’s when it hit me. Even though my book didn’t explode on launch day, it was still reaching the right people.

And sometimes, that’s all that matters.

The indie publishing long game

The best advice I can give to self-published authors? Keep writing, keep engaging, and don’t give up.

The books that succeed aren’t always the ones with the biggest ad budgets or the flashiest marketing campaigns. They’re the ones that connect with readers on a deeper level. They’re the books people recommend to their friends, bring to book clubs, and think about long after they’ve finished reading.

Your book doesn’t have to be an overnight sensation. It just has to find its audience—and sometimes, that takes time.","Photo by MIGUEL GASCOJ on Unsplash Today’s post is by author Janee’ Butterfield.

I wasn’t sure how many responses I’d get, but I was amazed at the level of engagement. Readers shared thoughtful insights, and some even pointed out details I hadn’t fully considered myself. That back-and-forth made them feel personally invested in my book—and when it launched, they were excited to share it with others. This experience made me realize something important: readers don’t just want to consume stories—they want to be part of the experience. Whether it’s helping pick a character’s name, voting on cover designs, or joining an exclusive reader group, small interactions create a loyal fanbase that keeps coming back. The importance of early reviews Reviews are one of the biggest challenges for indie authors. Even readers who love your book don’t always remember to leave one. But without reviews, books struggle to gain traction. To fix this, I started using BookSprout, a platform where authors can offer free review copies in exchange for honest feedback. This helped me build momentum early on, ensuring my books had reviews on launch day rather than waiting months for them to trickle in. Other strategies that worked for me: Sending ARCs (advance reader copies) to my newsletter subscribers Connecting with book bloggers who focus on indie authors Engaging with Goodreads communities that love my genre These efforts made a real difference. Reviews not only help with credibility, but they also increase your chances of being featured in Amazon’s recommendation engine, leading to more organic sales. Patience: the hardest but most important part If I could go back and give my past self advice, it would be this: don’t obsess over overnight success. I spent months wondering why my first book wasn’t taking off as fast as I wanted. What I didn’t realize was that some books take time. I remember the moment that changed my mindset—I got a message from a reader who had picked up Caught in Cryptic months after its release. She told me she couldn’t stop thinking about it and immediately bought Falling Cryptic. That’s when it hit me. Even though my book didn’t explode on launch day, it was still reaching the right people. And sometimes, that’s all that matters. The indie publishing long game The best advice I can give to self-published authors? Keep writing, keep engaging, and don’t give up. The books that succeed aren’t always the ones with the biggest ad budgets or the flashiest marketing campaigns. They’re the ones that connect with readers on a deeper level. They’re the books people recommend to their friends, bring to book clubs, and think about long after they’ve finished reading. Your book doesn’t have to be an overnight sensation. It just has to find its audience—and sometimes, that takes time.","the power of a second (or third) book When I released Caught in Cryptic, I poured everything into marketing it, hoping for an immediate surge in sales . I ran Amazon ads, posted across social media, and told every friend and family member about my debut .","book released, second book, amazon ads"

Google,Chrome disabling uBlock Origin is a serious security threat,"TL;DR: Google’s recent decision to disable the popular ad-blocking extension uBlock Origin on Chrome is raising significant concerns about user security. This move has left many users vulnerable to a sudden influx of malicious ads that they weren’t accustomed to seeing. We tech-savvy folks need to educate our friends and family about the dangers of the internet, but it would be nice if Google provided a more user-friendly solution for installing alternative ad-blockers.

Shameless personal ad: Building an API? Try Fuego, the FastAPI-like framework for the Go programming language!

When it happens for real

Let me share a story that hits close to home. My relative (I’ll withhold her identity for her safety), who isn’t very tech-savvy, had been using uBlock Origin for years to browse the web ad-free. Recently, she saw a tooltip in Chrome suggesting she disable uBlock Origin. Trusting the recommendation, she did so without realizing the consequences.

Shortly after, while browsing, she encountered a pop-up that looked like a Windows warning, claiming her computer was compromised. It was the first time in her life she had seen something like this—uBlock had always protected her from such ads. Panicked, she followed the instructions, which included pressing Windows+R to open the Run command and pasting a command that had been automatically copied to her clipboard from the malicious website.

The command installed malware/adware, but fortunately, I was able to quickly remove it from her computer.

Unforeseen Consequences

For millions of elderly users and those less familiar with technology, uBlock Origin has been a lifesaver. I installed it on all my relatives’ browsers. It blocks ads, cookies, warnings, and overlays, providing a crucial layer of protection against malicious and deceptive content. With Chrome disabling uBlock Origin, however, these users are suddenly exposed to a barrage of ads, some of which can be both deceptive and harmful.

Next Steps

There are a few alternatives available. Unfortunately, moving to Firefox may not be a viable option for her, because she’s 80 yo and so used to the Chrome UI. However, users can install other ad-blocking applications that are compatible with Manifest V3. It is important to note that these alternatives may not be as effective as uBlock Origin, as they are designed to comply with Google’s new standards—which are more lenient toward ads, especially Google’s ads, of course.

I understand that I should educate my relative about the dark side of the internet, but that takes time, and even then, it isn’t foolproof, whereas uBlock was.

It would be nice if Google proposed a method for installing alternative ad-blockers instead of leaving our elders unprotected.","TL;DR: Google’s recent decision to disable the popular ad-blocking extension uBlock Origin on Chrome is raising significant concerns about user security.

Google,How to Outrank Big Competitors in Search,"John Jantsch (00:00.98)

Hello and welcome to another episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast. This is John Jantsch and my guest today is Sam Dunning. He is the founder at Breaking B2B, an SEO firm and the host of podcast by the same name, Breaking B2B. So Sam, welcome to the show.

Sam Dunning (00:20.738)

Hey John, thanks for having me on man. Looking forward to the chat.

John Jantsch (00:23.822)

So I know that one of your promises, taglines, messages, whatever we want to call it, SEO for revenue, not vanity. So let's start there. How do you define that distinction and how do you use that to sort of differentiate yourself from other SEO firms?

Sam Dunning (00:42.742)

Yeah, great place to start. So in short, it's after going through the pain myself. It's so before I got into SEO as a profession or ran my own consultancy or agency, kind of working with past agencies, teams, contractors, and also potential clients, prospects, and customers that come to us. So much of the time get frustrated as they've either tried to do SEO themselves.

hired contractors, hired teams or whoever it may be, but have focused on the wrong metrics or wrong outcomes. So they've fallen into what I call John the traffic trap, which is even more important in the world of AI as AI search, LLMs take over slowly beat at Google's market share. They've fallen into something called the traffic trap. What does the traffic trap means? Well, it means they go for informational based keywords on Google search.

John Jantsch (01:38.48)

businesses.

Sam Dunning (01:39.734)

So think of things like simple searches, like what is a KPI, how to build a website, what is a CRM, stuff that's easily answerable nowadays with things like AI overviews in Google, which show up as really high juicy traffic terms, but are not likely to result in conversions, AKA inbound leads, demo requests, booked calls, or whatever that main call to action your B2B company wants.

John Jantsch (01:50.49)

Yep.

Sam Dunning (02:07.092)

So they fall into that trap thinking we need to get traffic at all costs, but it's not going to result in, or it's very unlikely to result in a book called demo or conversion. Now I thought, well, that's a waste of time, especially running, running a business myself. And I'm sure you're the same John, like most marketing that we put, whether it's our own resource or agencies or contractors want to result in actual kind of qualified leads or revenue. So we flipped that on its head. thought, how can we do the opposite of that?

and focus on what is a dream client actually searching for when they need our offer, when they have this very specific problem we solve or they're comparing alternatives and how can we show up and start driving qualified inbound traffic for those terms.

John Jantsch (02:50.0)

Yeah, and I think one of the things, know, there are a lot of people that have enjoyed what looked like a lot of good organic traffic that are kind of freaking out because all of those information searches are going away or Google's like hoarding them, right? And so a lot of people have seen real drops in traffic and they're freaking out, right? But what you're saying is that was garbage traffic anyway, wasn't

Sam Dunning (03:03.566)

Mm.

Sam Dunning (03:10.978)

Yeah, now, now don't get me wrong, top of funnel or informational based SEO isn't completely dead. But if you're doing a very light version of it, stuff that can be simply answered by an AI or LLM, then that probably is a waste of your time. And those prospects that are searching for that kind of stuff, like very simple what is or very simple how to terms are probably just going to land on your page, get the info and bounce off.

John Jantsch (03:35.93)

Yeah, yeah, I do. I do it dozens of times a day myself, right? You because I just want to figure out like, how do I make that thing work in this tool that I'm using? And I know I could find somebody who's written about it, but I can't even tell you what their website was or what it was about. So SEO really, with a lot of small business clients, is so misunderstood that it gets a really bad rap, you know, because a lot of people hire SEO people, they don't know what they're doing.

Sam Dunning (03:51.522)

Yeah, yeah, that's it.

John Jantsch (04:04.804)

they're getting some reports once a month that seem to say they're ranking for something and ultimately they get really frustrated. And, so, you know, what is it that you think, the, the, the, true, like value-based, let's put it that way. Cause there are a lot of scammers out there. The true sort of value-based SEO firm is, is going to be telling their clients today. that is kind of different.

different than smoke and mirrors that I think a lot of SEO folks have used to describe what they're doing.

Sam Dunning (04:37.238)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'd say one of the first things is that SEO is not for every business. And what do I mean by that? Well, I mean, first and foremost, you have to be in a sector that actually has demand to capture. So you have to be in a known category and have folks, AKA your dream clients or prospects actively searching for your offer. Because if you're trying to create some kind of new tool, new service, new offer, Google is, SEO is always best as a demand capture channel.

John Jantsch (04:43.216)

Hmm.

Sam Dunning (05:05.036)

So you need prospects in market searching for your offer. That's the first thing. The second thing is you actually have to have resource to make it worthwhile. Whether that is your own cash, like you mentioned, they're hiring a contractor agency, whoever it may be, that you can invest to actually give it a good amount of time to see success, or you need the resource in-house. Marketers that actually know what makes a solid SEO campaign.

know how to actually build a revenue driving SEO program, whether that is creating, doing solid keyword research around what your dream clients search or when they need the offer, building content that matches that intent that resonates with dream clients and is also following SEO best practices than the other elements of SEO, be it link building, technical SEO, et cetera. And you have to have the longevity to make it worthwhile. And you can, don't get me wrong, you can see results with SEO done right as quick as 90 days, but

John Jantsch (05:56.613)

Yes.

Sam Dunning (06:03.762)

If you're looking at it as a quick hit and you're thinking, yeah, I'll do this for a month. Then I might switch and do paid ads. Then I might do some social ads. Then I might try some outbound sales. Then I might do some review sites. Then it is a waste of your time. Do another channel that you can give a chance or stick to paid media.

John Jantsch (06:20.398)

Yeah. So what do you tell a client when, mean, because you, just told me something a lot of clients don't want to hear, right? It's like, no, I, you know, I, see my top three competitors are, know, on top of Google. How come I'm not? so, you know, how do you kind of set the expectation for that fact that it's a long-term game? Because let's face it, there have been SEO folks that I sound like I'm really negative SEO, but I've just seen too many small businesses get kind of burned by just not understanding it. And so not knowing what they're even buying,

Sam Dunning (06:46.53)

Yeah, I get it.

John Jantsch (06:49.902)

So because a lot of SEO firms hide behind that, it's a long-term game, it's a long-term game, which just means you're never gonna get results.

Sam Dunning (06:57.516)

Yeah, it's that classic response, right? Like the client says, or the potential customer says, how long does SEO take agency says, six to 12 months, sign our 12 month retainer and we'll be good. So what you said is correct in the sense that let's face it. Most of us, whether we're a B2B service company, tech company, software company, we have giant competitors, right? We've got the top three, the top four, the top five that always come up in sales conversations to an annoying level.

John Jantsch (07:06.298)

Right.

Sam Dunning (07:25.57)

And they're probably, if we've not done SEO ranking above us for some of those core terms that we want to start driving leads for. Now, usually for those juicy terms, there's quite often competitors owning those. So let me give you a tangible example. If let's pretend we sold proposal software as a tool. We might want to own terms like best proposal software or best proposal tools, et cetera.

But those are gonna be extremely competitive. You've got massive software companies like Proposify, Quilla, PandaDoc, well-funded companies that have a ton of cash to spend on marketing and SEO. Now, how can we beat these companies? Because we're probably not gonna get ranked for that keyword for years, realistically. Well, that's when you need to do something called long tail SEO. And you need to, instead of thinking like we're gonna rank for best proposal software in this instance, we might go for things like, we might pick niches that...

that are maybe underserved or that we've historically sold well into. So you might think, all right, short term, like the next three months or so, we're gonna go for like proposal software for FinTech teams or for sales teams or for HR teams, or we're gonna target competitors. Like we're gonna go for Proposify alternatives or GetAccept alternatives, all that kind of stuff. there's always quick wins you can grab with SEO, but it's naturally knowing first and foremost, what niches you wanna target.

John Jantsch (08:28.464)

Mm-hmm.

John Jantsch (08:43.14)

you

Sam Dunning (08:44.972)

what your prospects might be searching for and realizing that those really super competitive terms are going to be owned by the giants and that we have to chip away at the stuff they're under serving.

John Jantsch (08:53.936)

Yeah. And I love that idea. You know, I have people come to me all the time and they're starting a business and they're like, should I choose a niche? And I'm like, well, my take is, mean, if you have a real reason, like you're an expert in that and you've worked in it all your life. Otherwise, I think what happens is a lot of people choose niches they think are good. And, but, you know, then they're like six months later having to start their business over again. but I'm always telling people you don't have to choose a niche, but you should niche your marketing.

Sam Dunning (09:15.48)

Mm.

John Jantsch (09:21.412)

And that's really what you're talking about is that, you have campaigns that are like, say professional services is a category for you. Well, there's 10 subcategories in there and you should be messaging to those 10 subcategories. And I'm hearing you say that that's a, that's a solid foundation for approaching SEO today.

Sam Dunning (09:42.122)

Exactly right exactly right. So I always say Like going back to marketing fundamentals like SEO Let's ignore SEO for a second the main marketing fundamentals are have an offer But have an offer that serves a dream client that ideally has historically bought well into your service is in a niche that can easily Ford your offer Has the expensive problem you solve is motivated to solve it and has no issue spending cash on it

If you can get those lined up, that's good, not just for SEO, but for marketing in general. So I have a very simple, I'm a simple guy. A lot of my strategies are straightforward when it comes to actually building out your SEO, like what keywords should we target? What type of content should we create? I recommend folks, whether it's a founder, whether it's your marketing leader, whoever in your organization makes sense. The very simple strategy for finding what I call money keywords, which in simple terms of commercial keywords that your dream clients will search for needing your offer.

Fire up a Google Sheet, fire up an Excel Sheet, split it into four main columns. Column one is what you actually call your offer. Going back to proposal software, that might be proposal software, proposal tools, proposal platform. Column two, what are those money niches that you've historically sold well that can have the problem you solve and motivate to solve it and can easily afford the offer? Could be, like you said, financial firms, accountancies, whatever those niches are. The third is what are those main competitors that always come up in sales calls? That's column three. And the fourth is...

This is probably a framework you've talked about on the podcast. I'm sure jobs to be done. What are your dream clients jobs to be done? What are those struggling moments they face? Maybe they try to do something internally, like they cobbled together a solution on Google sheets or Excel, or maybe in the sales proposal world, like it would be like something like how to build a sales proposal within Google docs or how to, how to build out sales proposals that convert all that kind of stuff. Why do I build those four columns? Well,

John Jantsch (11:14.544)

Mm-hmm, true.

Sam Dunning (11:37.486)

It helps me build out long tail keywords that my dream clients were actually going to search for needing the offer. And if I get, if I'm, if I have a team, then I might involve my sales team. So they can actually come with me to say, look, these are competitors that come up. These are the niches that are doing well right now. Um, these are the common frustrations or our clients jobs to be done or struggling moments. And then we can have well-informed keyword research. That's also going to fuel our content when we get to that stage.

that our target prospects are probably actually looking for when they need our offer.

John Jantsch (12:10.248)

So one of the things that if we could do a quick search and find 10 blog posts on people saying SEO is dying and AI is going to eat all SEO organic traffic. one of the things I'm hearing you say is, or at least that I'm seeing is, if you're really focused on high demand, AI is not really returning results for somebody who is looking to hire

an accountant in their community right now, right? mean, if somebody who's really doing that level of search, they're not getting an AI overview for that, are they?

Sam Dunning (12:46.766)

Not so much not to say there aren't it's like right now from what we're saying a lot of the AI Overviews and more for informational based searches Not always but quite a lot of time now. There's there's obviously two sides to the coin with your typical Google result now There's sometimes an AI overview at the top Then you've got some a couple sponsored listings. Then you've got the organic results in between but that aside You've also got LLMs like chat GPT search perplexity, etc

John Jantsch (12:49.956)

Mm-hmm.

Sam Dunning (13:16.416)

Now, a lot of folks are saying stuff like, when I say a lot of folks, mean, random marketers on LinkedIn, et cetera, they like to make a lot of noise and saying stuff like Google search is dying and all this kind of stuff. the truth is that LLMs, whether that is chat, chat, GPT, perplexity, et cetera, are gaining chat. GPT is especially are gaining a bit more market share, but it's nothing in comparison to Google. Google's still growing and it still is by far the most searched engine. when it comes to those prospects.

John Jantsch (13:26.405)

Yes.

John Jantsch (13:44.752)

So what do we, just to put a number on that, 2, 3 % for the LLM?

Sam Dunning (13:50.67)

I can't, I can't remember what it's last valued at, but Brian Fishkin has just done a report. So one of the, one of the well-known SEOs he's just put out a report to show that I mean, Google is literally kind of a hundred X or so more compared to some of these LLMs. So what I'm saying is the thing to consider is if you have a more technical user, so if your end clients are more technical, they're probably using more AI search. If not, they're more of a layman.

They're probably still using Google for now, but it's more to be aware that AI is on the rise. We can certainly dive into some ways that you can rank on LLMs and chat to you between similar happy to dive into that. But I think that's one thing to bear in mind. Most folks are still using Google when they have intent to review offers.

John Jantsch (14:36.848)

Yeah. Sometimes we forget about, you know, what our target market does. Like, do they read the newspaper? Do they, you know, it's like, that's what we need to pay attention to. Right. So, so, uh, instead of ranking on the LLMs, I'd let's for a minute go into local search. Um, so a lot of, let's say I'm a local home remodeler. Um, I mean, in, in this day and age search has really been, I mean, we can run ads and do things, but search has been a big driver of business, uh, for me, especially if I can get myself in that three pack.

Sam Dunning (14:50.211)

Mm-hmm.

John Jantsch (15:05.776)

So how is local search going to be impacted?

Sam Dunning (15:10.614)

Yeah. I mean, to be blunt, I don't do tons with local businesses. most exactly, exactly. So a lot of my clients are kind of more national, not necessarily serving, serving small end industries. Now, yeah, some of that, again, some of that, certain searches will, will be appearing in whether it's Google AI overviews. So you get the quick review, and that sort of things. And I think more of it is understanding the crux of SEO in my opinion, at least.

John Jantsch (15:14.67)

Yeah, because B2B is more national, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Sam Dunning (15:40.814)

is yes, you follow simple guidelines with technical. So for example, if you were, say, I don't know, providing HVAC in a certain state of the U S so let's say in New Jersey, those kinds of HVAC services in New Jersey, for example, if we actually want to typically what's going to rank for that is probably a landing page. And the usual framework I like to follow for a landing page is problem. Are you facing this problem with whatever's going on in your home? This is the impact of that problem.

We'll agitate a bit and then this is the solution. This is how we're well equipped to solve these issues, these bleedneck frustrations. And then you'll probably show some examples of your offer. You'll have some client testimonials and reviews might have an FAQ like what's your pricing? How long does it take? What's your refund policy? And you have a call to action to book a call. The crux of SEO is reviewing what's ranking right now. In this case for our target search term, this offer in this location.

And how can I completely blow that page out of the water? How can I make my page more helpful, more useful, more educational, trustworthy and convincing to this dream client? And a lot of that comes down to customer research, like knowing what your prospects actually care about their jobs to be done in their end goals. Yes, you need basic technical SEO. So you need your focus keyword in the URL. You need it in the H1 in the MetaTitle description. And you might want some internal links on that page to other blog articles or other useful pages. But if you can follow that framework.

With local SEO, in most cases, you can actually outrank competitors without even worrying about backlinks. Cause a lot of these local websites, they're not really doing a lot of SEO. They might have like a couple pages, like homepage, couple service pages, portfolio contact. If you can actually strategically build out what I call these money pages for like offer plus industry, offer plus location, and do that in a systematic way that's custom research backed, then you can, you can probably start ranking quite nicely and pulling in some leads.

John Jantsch (17:14.412)

Yeah. Right.

John Jantsch (17:36.034)

You said one of my favorite words that you Brits say, HVAC. I love that term.

It's a little different than the way us Americans pronounce it.

Sam Dunning (17:50.23)

It's also niche isn't it when Brits say niche and US says niche. I always get those two mixed up.

John Jantsch (17:51.788)

Yeah. Well, I have learned niche too. I rather prefer niche. So that's one. I have a lot of Canadians that are clients and a couple of their words of process is one that as opposed to process that I love to harass them about. you went into a business, they said, Hey, Sam,

Sam Dunning (17:59.071)

Okay.

John Jantsch (18:16.506)

Come help us. We're not ranking for anything. You know, they've got a decent business. They've got a decent product or offer. I mean, that's not really the issue. Where do you start? I mean, what do you, how do you kind of start the process? And let's say they've bought into, it's going to be a six month process. Do you have a set? You know, here's what we do first. Here's what we do next. Here's how we expand that.

Sam Dunning (18:37.678)

Yeah, yeah, so you start with what we briefly touched on earlier. So understanding the main offer, problems they solve, competitors, industries that they serve well, that have that expensive problem and motivated to fix it and have cash to easily invest in the offer. So you build out that Google sheet, formulating those offers, industries, jobs to be done and competitors, make those four main columns. And then from there,

John Jantsch (18:42.82)

Yep.

Sam Dunning (19:05.026)

We're making our money long tail commercial keywords. So what service do you want to make at us, Or what offer?

John Jantsch (19:12.99)

you know, let's do mine, marketing strategy.

Sam Dunning (19:16.182)

Okay, it's quite a nice broad one. And do we want to serve like specific niches? Are we gonna?

John Jantsch (19:18.442)

Yeah, let's go with home service businesses where we're going to serve like remodeling contractors, roofers, landscapers.

Sam Dunning (19:26.23)

Yep, lovely, lovely. Yeah, yeah, so we could, if we wanted to drill down on those niches, some of our offerings might be, some of our money keywords might be like marketing services for landscaping or best marketing agency for landscapers and hitting some of those home niches. And then once we've kind of worked out, once we've exhausted what I call these long tail keywords, and then if we go to kind of...

That would be kind of some of the high commercial intent keywords. If we, if we went more jobs to be done, it might be how to rank higher as my home services business or why is my business not showing up on Google? Why is my landscape business not driving leads or why is my landscaping website not converting? Those might be some of the struggling moment searches.

John Jantsch (20:11.442)

So those were all questions, by the way, right?

Sam Dunning (20:15.116)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those are things that probably come up on discovery calls. That's how you pull those. So make an exhaustive list of that. Like I said, if you're the founder, you'll know a lot of these, but if you perhaps have a sales team, they can help you contribute to that. Then simplest way to actually build content that ranks is to just Google those keywords. So let's say marketing agency for landscapers or best marketing agency for landscape or something like that. Google the keywords, see what the top three organic pages are.

John Jantsch (20:15.952)

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

John Jantsch (20:28.4)

Sure,

Sam Dunning (20:44.652)

what type of page they are. This is called addressing, assessing the intent. Is it a landing page, a blog article, a how-to, a product list, a comparison, whatever. Probably gonna be, I'd imagine a landing page for that type of keyword. It might be a top 10 comparison, like we reviewed the top marketing agencies in 2025 for landscapers. Probably one of the two. See what shows more in the organic search results. Let's pretend it's a landing page. I'd review the top.

John Jantsch (21:03.12)

Mm-hmm.

Sam Dunning (21:12.396)

three landing pages. So what's ranking now of my competitors. I look for gaps in those pages. Usually landing pages are quite thin. This is our offer. There's some testimonials. Here's a to action. So I would do what we talked about earlier, problem agitation solution based on our knowledge of the industry or ourselves team's knowledge. So start with the hero area, the top banner. This is the offer. Here's a call to action. Here's a book of cool calls to action. Are you facing these problems?

around your landscaping company, like struggling to drive leads for your website, competitors above you in organic search results or spending loads of cash on ads and not returning pipeline. Here's exactly how we fix it. Here's three video testimonials of customers we sold it for. Here's our exact process from A to Z. Here's some FAQs around our offer. Why are we more expensive than other marketing agencies? Do we have a proven process? Do we have a returns policy?

How quickly can I see results? All those FAQs from those kind of really tight objections you get on sales calls. And then yeah, follow the technical SEO basics. So the focus URL has the keywords. So yourdomain.com forward slash best landscaping marketing agency. Same for the H1, same for the meta title and description. So that's what I call the blow out the water strategy, review what's ranking, make your page more helpful, useful, educational, trustworthy.

John Jantsch (22:10.03)

Mm-hmm.

Sam Dunning (22:34.84)

Google rolled out a framework called EEAT, Experience Expertise Authority Trust a while back. And for more, I guess, for less competitive terms, that alone, doing that at scale in a systematic way, like saying, look, we're gonna publish, we're gonna build out and publish five to 10 pages each month, whatever's realistic for your company, we'll steadily get your rankings. When you get to more competitive terms, I don't know, in the marketing agency world, like things like best marketing agency in the US or whatever it might be,

John Jantsch (22:37.626)

Mm-hmm.

John Jantsch (22:52.624)

Yeah. Right.

Sam Dunning (23:03.886)

you're gonna have tons of competitors. That's when you'll need the help of backlinks to build up your website's authority. And there's a bunch of ways to build links, happy to dive into, but that's just a starting point that I'd recommend.

John Jantsch (23:07.918)

Yeah.

John Jantsch (23:17.348)

My favorite is guesting on podcasts, quite frankly, because we're going to link back to your site, Sam, and we're going to promote the heck out of this episode. so that to me is one of the best backlinks that you can get is going on people shows. Plus you get the exposure, you know, you might actually get a client because somebody listens to it. So that's my favorite. Yeah. Yeah.

Sam Dunning (23:36.79)

Yeah, it's great. It is one of the best. I'd probably put that as number one or number two for sure. My other favorite is building partnerships, which again has more holistic business play. So this is finding partners that serve the same ICP, the same idle client profile as you, but are not direct competitors. So as a real example, I partner with a LinkedIn ads agency, Impactable. They serve just like me, B2B service and B2B SaaS clients, but they're not going after SEO clients because they don't offer it. So.

John Jantsch (23:44.911)

Right.

Sam Dunning (24:05.518)

I approached their founder guy called Justin a while back and I'm a big fan, John of weird, painfully short messages if I'm trying to get stuff done. So I probably sent you one. I find the founder or the marketing leader on LinkedIn. I'll say something like, Hey Justin had a weird idea to scale your organic traffic and in bounds you against a conversation. He'll probably connect with me on LinkedIn or whatever channel I outreach email, whatever, and say, Sam, what are you on about? But let's hear what you've got to say. Then I'll shoot him like a loom video.

John Jantsch (24:30.084)

Yeah.

Sam Dunning (24:33.006)

and just say, look, I've got an idea. In this case, partnership play. The small step initially I might offer is I'll write out a guest blog article for you that will be really useful to your audience. And in return, I just want to link back. And then they might do that and that might grow into, okay, let's do a podcast together. Okay, let's do some more content together. All right, let's start presenting business each other's way. So it's gone from just a small SEO play to like reciprocal business. Just like your podcast is kind of has so much more play to it than just SEO.

John Jantsch (25:00.878)

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, Sam, I appreciate you taking a few moments to drop by the duct tape marketing podcast, where would you invite people to connect with you find out more about your work?

Sam Dunning (25:09.942)

I really appreciate it. Three, three main ways. Really one is LinkedIn. I post ramblings on SEO each and every day. The second is the Breaking B2B podcast where we interview just like this marketing leaders as well as solo episodes on SEO and what's working on marketing today. Or the third is if you're tired of seeing competitors above you and organic search results, stealing traffic inbound leads and more, then we might be able to fix it with our unusual approach to SEO. It's BreakingB2B.com. Happy to chat.

John Jantsch (25:37.584)

Again, appreciate you stopping by and hopefully we'll run into you one of these days out there on the road.

Sam Dunning (25:43.022)

Cheers, man. Thank you.","John Jantsch (00:00.98) Hello and welcome to another episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast. This is John Jantsch and my guest today is Sam Dunning. He is the founder at Breaking B2B, an SEO firm and the host of podcast by the same name, Breaking B2B. So Sam, welcome to the show. Sam Dunning (00:20.738) Hey John, thanks for having me on man. Looking forward to the chat. John Jantsch (00:23.822) So I know that one of your promises, taglines, messages, whatever we want to call it, SEO for revenue, not vanity. So let's start there. How do you define that distinction and how do you use that to sort of differentiate yourself from other SEO firms? Sam Dunning (00:42.742) Yeah, great place to start. So in short, it's after going through the pain myself. It's so before I got into SEO as a profession or ran my own consultancy or agency, kind of working with past agencies, teams, contractors, and also potential clients, prospects, and customers that come to us. So much of the time get frustrated as they've either tried to do SEO themselves. hired contractors, hired teams or whoever it may be, but have focused on the wrong metrics or wrong outcomes. So they've fallen into what I call John the traffic trap, which is even more important in the world of AI as AI search, LLMs take over slowly beat at Google's market share. They've fallen into something called the traffic trap. What does the traffic trap means? Well, it means they go for informational based keywords on Google search. John Jantsch (01:38.48) businesses. Sam Dunning (01:39.734) So think of things like simple searches, like what is a KPI, how to build a website, what is a CRM, stuff that's easily answerable nowadays with things like AI overviews in Google, which show up as really high juicy traffic terms, but are not likely to result in conversions, AKA inbound leads, demo requests, booked calls, or whatever that main call to action your B2B company wants. John Jantsch (01:50.49) Yep. Sam Dunning (02:07.092) So they fall into that trap thinking we need to get traffic at all costs, but it's not going to result in, or it's very unlikely to result in a book called demo or conversion. Now I thought, well, that's a waste of time, especially running, running a business myself. And I'm sure you're the same John, like most marketing that we put, whether it's our own resource or agencies or contractors want to result in actual kind of qualified leads or revenue. So we flipped that on its head. thought, how can we do the opposite of that? and focus on what is a dream client actually searching for when they need our offer, when they have this very specific problem we solve or they're comparing alternatives and how can we show up and start driving qualified inbound traffic for those terms. John Jantsch (02:50.0) Yeah, and I think one of the things, know, there are a lot of people that have enjoyed what looked like a lot of good organic traffic that are kind of freaking out because all of those information searches are going away or Google's like hoarding them, right? And so a lot of people have seen real drops in traffic and they're freaking out, right? But what you're saying is that was garbage traffic anyway, wasn't Sam Dunning (03:03.566) Mm. Sam Dunning (03:10.978) Yeah, now, now don't get me wrong, top of funnel or informational based SEO isn't completely dead. But if you're doing a very light version of it, stuff that can be simply answered by an AI or LLM, then that probably is a waste of your time. And those prospects that are searching for that kind of stuff, like very simple what is or very simple how to terms are probably just going to land on your page, get the info and bounce off. John Jantsch (03:35.93) Yeah, yeah, I do. I do it dozens of times a day myself, right? You because I just want to figure out like, how do I make that thing work in this tool that I'm using? And I know I could find somebody who's written about it, but I can't even tell you what their website was or what it was about. So SEO really, with a lot of small business clients, is so misunderstood that it gets a really bad rap, you know, because a lot of people hire SEO people, they don't know what they're doing. Sam Dunning (03:51.522) Yeah, yeah, that's it. John Jantsch (04:04.804) they're getting some reports once a month that seem to say they're ranking for something and ultimately they get really frustrated. And, so, you know, what is it that you think, the, the, the, true, like value-based, let's put it that way. Cause there are a lot of scammers out there. The true sort of value-based SEO firm is, is going to be telling their clients today. that is kind of different. different than smoke and mirrors that I think a lot of SEO folks have used to describe what they're doing. Sam Dunning (04:37.238) Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'd say one of the first things is that SEO is not for every business. And what do I mean by that? Well, I mean, first and foremost, you have to be in a sector that actually has demand to capture. So you have to be in a known category and have folks, AKA your dream clients or prospects actively searching for your offer. Because if you're trying to create some kind of new tool, new service, new offer, Google is, SEO is always best as a demand capture channel. John Jantsch (04:43.216) Hmm. Sam Dunning (05:05.036) So you need prospects in market searching for your offer. That's the first thing. The second thing is you actually have to have resource to make it worthwhile. Whether that is your own cash, like you mentioned, they're hiring a contractor agency, whoever it may be, that you can invest to actually give it a good amount of time to see success, or you need the resource in-house. Marketers that actually know what makes a solid SEO campaign. know how to actually build a revenue driving SEO program, whether that is creating, doing solid keyword research around what your dream clients search or when they need the offer, building content that matches that intent that resonates with dream clients and is also following SEO best practices than the other elements of SEO, be it link building, technical SEO, et cetera. And you have to have the longevity to make it worthwhile. And you can, don't get me wrong, you can see results with SEO done right as quick as 90 days, but John Jantsch (05:56.613) Yes. Sam Dunning (06:03.762) If you're looking at it as a quick hit and you're thinking, yeah, I'll do this for a month. Then I might switch and do paid ads. Then I might do some social ads. Then I might try some outbound sales. Then I might do some review sites. Then it is a waste of your time. Do another channel that you can give a chance or stick to paid media. John Jantsch (06:20.398) Yeah. So what do you tell a client when, mean, because you, just told me something a lot of clients don't want to hear, right? It's like, no, I, you know, I, see my top three competitors are, know, on top of Google. How come I'm not? so, you know, how do you kind of set the expectation for that fact that it's a long-term game? Because let's face it, there have been SEO folks that I sound like I'm really negative SEO, but I've just seen too many small businesses get kind of burned by just not understanding it. And so not knowing what they're even buying, Sam Dunning (06:46.53) Yeah, I get it. John Jantsch (06:49.902) So because a lot of SEO firms hide behind that, it's a long-term game, it's a long-term game, which just means you're never gonna get results. Sam Dunning (06:57.516) Yeah, it's that classic response, right? Like the client says, or the potential customer says, how long does SEO take agency says, six to 12 months, sign our 12 month retainer and we'll be good. So what you said is correct in the sense that let's face it. Most of us, whether we're a B2B service company, tech company, software company, we have giant competitors, right? We've got the top three, the top four, the top five that always come up in sales conversations to an annoying level. John Jantsch (07:06.298) Right. Sam Dunning (07:25.57) And they're probably, if we've not done SEO ranking above us for some of those core terms that we want to start driving leads for. Now, usually for those juicy terms, there's quite often competitors owning those. So let me give you a tangible example. If let's pretend we sold proposal software as a tool. We might want to own terms like best proposal software or best proposal tools, et cetera. But those are gonna be extremely competitive. You've got massive software companies like Proposify, Quilla, PandaDoc, well-funded companies that have a ton of cash to spend on marketing and SEO. Now, how can we beat these companies? Because we're probably not gonna get ranked for that keyword for years, realistically. Well, that's when you need to do something called long tail SEO. And you need to, instead of thinking like we're gonna rank for best proposal software in this instance, we might go for things like, we might pick niches that... that are maybe underserved or that we've historically sold well into. So you might think, all right, short term, like the next three months or so, we're gonna go for like proposal software for FinTech teams or for sales teams or for HR teams, or we're gonna target competitors. Like we're gonna go for Proposify alternatives or GetAccept alternatives, all that kind of stuff. there's always quick wins you can grab with SEO, but it's naturally knowing first and foremost, what niches you wanna target. John Jantsch (08:28.464) Mm-hmm. John Jantsch (08:43.14) you Sam Dunning (08:44.972) what your prospects might be searching for and realizing that those really super competitive terms are going to be owned by the giants and that we have to chip away at the stuff they're under serving. John Jantsch (08:53.936) Yeah. And I love that idea. You know, I have people come to me all the time and they're starting a business and they're like, should I choose a niche? And I'm like, well, my take is, mean, if you have a real reason, like you're an expert in that and you've worked in it all your life. Otherwise, I think what happens is a lot of people choose niches they think are good. And, but, you know, then they're like six months later having to start their business over again. but I'm always telling people you don't have to choose a niche, but you should niche your marketing. Sam Dunning (09:15.48) Mm. John Jantsch (09:21.412) And that's really what you're talking about is that, you have campaigns that are like, say professional services is a category for you. Well, there's 10 subcategories in there and you should be messaging to those 10 subcategories. And I'm hearing you say that that's a, that's a solid foundation for approaching SEO today. Sam Dunning (09:42.122) Exactly right exactly right. So I always say Like going back to marketing fundamentals like SEO Let's ignore SEO for a second the main marketing fundamentals are have an offer But have an offer that serves a dream client that ideally has historically bought well into your service is in a niche that can easily Ford your offer Has the expensive problem you solve is motivated to solve it and has no issue spending cash on it If you can get those lined up, that's good, not just for SEO, but for marketing in general. So I have a very simple, I'm a simple guy. A lot of my strategies are straightforward when it comes to actually building out your SEO, like what keywords should we target? What type of content should we create? I recommend folks, whether it's a founder, whether it's your marketing leader, whoever in your organization makes sense. The very simple strategy for finding what I call money keywords, which in simple terms of commercial keywords that your dream clients will search for needing your offer. Fire up a Google Sheet, fire up an Excel Sheet, split it into four main columns. Column one is what you actually call your offer. Going back to proposal software, that might be proposal software, proposal tools, proposal platform. Column two, what are those money niches that you've historically sold well that can have the problem you solve and motivate to solve it and can easily afford the offer? Could be, like you said, financial firms, accountancies, whatever those niches are. The third is what are those main competitors that always come up in sales calls? That's column three. And the fourth is... This is probably a framework you've talked about on the podcast. I'm sure jobs to be done. What are your dream clients jobs to be done? What are those struggling moments they face? Maybe they try to do something internally, like they cobbled together a solution on Google sheets or Excel, or maybe in the sales proposal world, like it would be like something like how to build a sales proposal within Google docs or how to, how to build out sales proposals that convert all that kind of stuff. Why do I build those four columns? Well, John Jantsch (11:14.544) Mm-hmm, true. Sam Dunning (11:37.486) It helps me build out long tail keywords that my dream clients were actually going to search for needing the offer. And if I get, if I'm, if I have a team, then I might involve my sales team. So they can actually come with me to say, look, these are competitors that come up. These are the niches that are doing well right now. Um, these are the common frustrations or our clients jobs to be done or struggling moments. And then we can have well-informed keyword research. That's also going to fuel our content when we get to that stage. that our target prospects are probably actually looking for when they need our offer. John Jantsch (12:10.248) So one of the things that if we could do a quick search and find 10 blog posts on people saying SEO is dying and AI is going to eat all SEO organic traffic. one of the things I'm hearing you say is, or at least that I'm seeing is, if you're really focused on high demand, AI is not really returning results for somebody who is looking to hire an accountant in their community right now, right? mean, if somebody who's really doing that level of search, they're not getting an AI overview for that, are they? Sam Dunning (12:46.766) Not so much not to say there aren't it's like right now from what we're saying a lot of the AI Overviews and more for informational based searches Not always but quite a lot of time now. There's there's obviously two sides to the coin with your typical Google result now There's sometimes an AI overview at the top Then you've got some a couple sponsored listings. Then you've got the organic results in between but that aside You've also got LLMs like chat GPT search perplexity, etc John Jantsch (12:49.956) Mm-hmm. Sam Dunning (13:16.416) Now, a lot of folks are saying stuff like, when I say a lot of folks, mean, random marketers on LinkedIn, et cetera, they like to make a lot of noise and saying stuff like Google search is dying and all this kind of stuff. the truth is that LLMs, whether that is chat, chat, GPT, perplexity, et cetera, are gaining chat. GPT is especially are gaining a bit more market share, but it's nothing in comparison to Google. Google's still growing and it still is by far the most searched engine. when it comes to those prospects. John Jantsch (13:26.405) Yes. John Jantsch (13:44.752) So what do we, just to put a number on that, 2, 3 % for the LLM? Sam Dunning (13:50.67) I can't, I can't remember what it's last valued at, but Brian Fishkin has just done a report. So one of the, one of the well-known SEOs he's just put out a report to show that I mean, Google is literally kind of a hundred X or so more compared to some of these LLMs. So what I'm saying is the thing to consider is if you have a more technical user, so if your end clients are more technical, they're probably using more AI search. If not, they're more of a layman. They're probably still using Google for now, but it's more to be aware that AI is on the rise. We can certainly dive into some ways that you can rank on LLMs and chat to you between similar happy to dive into that. But I think that's one thing to bear in mind. Most folks are still using Google when they have intent to review offers. John Jantsch (14:36.848) Yeah. Sometimes we forget about, you know, what our target market does. Like, do they read the newspaper? Do they, you know, it's like, that's what we need to pay attention to. Right. So, so, uh, instead of ranking on the LLMs, I'd let's for a minute go into local search. Um, so a lot of, let's say I'm a local home remodeler. Um, I mean, in, in this day and age search has really been, I mean, we can run ads and do things, but search has been a big driver of business, uh, for me, especially if I can get myself in that three pack. Sam Dunning (14:50.211) Mm-hmm. John Jantsch (15:05.776) So how is local search going to be impacted? Sam Dunning (15:10.614) Yeah. I mean, to be blunt, I don't do tons with local businesses. most exactly, exactly. So a lot of my clients are kind of more national, not necessarily serving, serving small end industries. Now, yeah, some of that, again, some of that, certain searches will, will be appearing in whether it's Google AI overviews. So you get the quick review, and that sort of things. And I think more of it is understanding the crux of SEO in my opinion, at least. John Jantsch (15:14.67) Yeah, because B2B is more national, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sam Dunning (15:40.814) is yes, you follow simple guidelines with technical. So for example, if you were, say, I don't know, providing HVAC in a certain state of the U S so let's say in New Jersey, those kinds of HVAC services in New Jersey, for example, if we actually want to typically what's going to rank for that is probably a landing page. And the usual framework I like to follow for a landing page is problem. Are you facing this problem with whatever's going on in your home? This is the impact of that problem. We'll agitate a bit and then this is the solution. This is how we're well equipped to solve these issues, these bleedneck frustrations. And then you'll probably show some examples of your offer. You'll have some client testimonials and reviews might have an FAQ like what's your pricing? How long does it take? What's your refund policy? And you have a call to action to book a call. The crux of SEO is reviewing what's ranking right now. In this case for our target search term, this offer in this location. And how can I completely blow that page out of the water? How can I make my page more helpful, more useful, more educational, trustworthy and convincing to this dream client? And a lot of that comes down to customer research, like knowing what your prospects actually care about their jobs to be done in their end goals. Yes, you need basic technical SEO. So you need your focus keyword in the URL. You need it in the H1 in the MetaTitle description. And you might want some internal links on that page to other blog articles or other useful pages. But if you can follow that framework. With local SEO, in most cases, you can actually outrank competitors without even worrying about backlinks. Cause a lot of these local websites, they're not really doing a lot of SEO. They might have like a couple pages, like homepage, couple service pages, portfolio contact. If you can actually strategically build out what I call these money pages for like offer plus industry, offer plus location, and do that in a systematic way that's custom research backed, then you can, you can probably start ranking quite nicely and pulling in some leads. John Jantsch (17:14.412) Yeah. Right. John Jantsch (17:36.034) You said one of my favorite words that you Brits say, HVAC. I love that term. It's a little different than the way us Americans pronounce it. Sam Dunning (17:50.23) It's also niche isn't it when Brits say niche and US says niche. I always get those two mixed up. John Jantsch (17:51.788) Yeah. Well, I have learned niche too. I rather prefer niche. So that's one. I have a lot of Canadians that are clients and a couple of their words of process is one that as opposed to process that I love to harass them about. you went into a business, they said, Hey, Sam, Sam Dunning (17:59.071) Okay. John Jantsch (18:16.506) Come help us. We're not ranking for anything. You know, they've got a decent business. They've got a decent product or offer. I mean, that's not really the issue. Where do you start? I mean, what do you, how do you kind of start the process? And let's say they've bought into, it's going to be a six month process. Do you have a set? You know, here's what we do first. Here's what we do next. Here's how we expand that. Sam Dunning (18:37.678) Yeah, yeah, so you start with what we briefly touched on earlier. So understanding the main offer, problems they solve, competitors, industries that they serve well, that have that expensive problem and motivated to fix it and have cash to easily invest in the offer. So you build out that Google sheet, formulating those offers, industries, jobs to be done and competitors, make those four main columns. And then from there, John Jantsch (18:42.82) Yep. Sam Dunning (19:05.026) We're making our money long tail commercial keywords. So what service do you want to make at us, Or what offer? John Jantsch (19:12.99) you know, let's do mine, marketing strategy. Sam Dunning (19:16.182) Okay, it's quite a nice broad one. And do we want to serve like specific niches? Are we gonna? John Jantsch (19:18.442) Yeah, let's go with home service businesses where we're going to serve like remodeling contractors, roofers, landscapers. Sam Dunning (19:26.23) Yep, lovely, lovely. Yeah, yeah, so we could, if we wanted to drill down on those niches, some of our offerings might be, some of our money keywords might be like marketing services for landscaping or best marketing agency for landscapers and hitting some of those home niches. And then once we've kind of worked out, once we've exhausted what I call these long tail keywords, and then if we go to kind of... That would be kind of some of the high commercial intent keywords. If we, if we went more jobs to be done, it might be how to rank higher as my home services business or why is my business not showing up on Google? Why is my landscape business not driving leads or why is my landscaping website not converting? Those might be some of the struggling moment searches. John Jantsch (20:11.442) So those were all questions, by the way, right? Sam Dunning (20:15.116) Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those are things that probably come up on discovery calls. That's how you pull those. So make an exhaustive list of that. Like I said, if you're the founder, you'll know a lot of these, but if you perhaps have a sales team, they can help you contribute to that. Then simplest way to actually build content that ranks is to just Google those keywords. So let's say marketing agency for landscapers or best marketing agency for landscape or something like that. Google the keywords, see what the top three organic pages are. John Jantsch (20:15.952) Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. John Jantsch (20:28.4) Sure, Sam Dunning (20:44.652) what type of page they are. This is called addressing, assessing the intent. Is it a landing page, a blog article, a how-to, a product list, a comparison, whatever. Probably gonna be, I'd imagine a landing page for that type of keyword. It might be a top 10 comparison, like we reviewed the top marketing agencies in 2025 for landscapers. Probably one of the two. See what shows more in the organic search results. Let's pretend it's a landing page. I'd review the top. John Jantsch (21:03.12) Mm-hmm. Sam Dunning (21:12.396) three landing pages. So what's ranking now of my competitors. I look for gaps in those pages. Usually landing pages are quite thin. This is our offer. There's some testimonials. Here's a to action. So I would do what we talked about earlier, problem agitation solution based on our knowledge of the industry or ourselves team's knowledge. So start with the hero area, the top banner. This is the offer. Here's a call to action. Here's a book of cool calls to action. Are you facing these problems? around your landscaping company, like struggling to drive leads for your website, competitors above you in organic search results or spending loads of cash on ads and not returning pipeline. Here's exactly how we fix it. Here's three video testimonials of customers we sold it for. Here's our exact process from A to Z. Here's some FAQs around our offer. Why are we more expensive than other marketing agencies? Do we have a proven process? Do we have a returns policy? How quickly can I see results? All those FAQs from those kind of really tight objections you get on sales calls. And then yeah, follow the technical SEO basics. So the focus URL has the keywords. So yourdomain.com forward slash best landscaping marketing agency. Same for the H1, same for the meta title and description. So that's what I call the blow out the water strategy, review what's ranking, make your page more helpful, useful, educational, trustworthy. John Jantsch (22:10.03) Mm-hmm. Sam Dunning (22:34.84) Google rolled out a framework called EEAT, Experience Expertise Authority Trust a while back. And for more, I guess, for less competitive terms, that alone, doing that at scale in a systematic way, like saying, look, we're gonna publish, we're gonna build out and publish five to 10 pages each month, whatever's realistic for your company, we'll steadily get your rankings. When you get to more competitive terms, I don't know, in the marketing agency world, like things like best marketing agency in the US or whatever it might be, John Jantsch (22:37.626) Mm-hmm. John Jantsch (22:52.624) Yeah. Right. Sam Dunning (23:03.886) you're gonna have tons of competitors. That's when you'll need the help of backlinks to build up your website's authority. And there's a bunch of ways to build links, happy to dive into, but that's just a starting point that I'd recommend. John Jantsch (23:07.918) Yeah. John Jantsch (23:17.348) My favorite is guesting on podcasts, quite frankly, because we're going to link back to your site, Sam, and we're going to promote the heck out of this episode. so that to me is one of the best backlinks that you can get is going on people shows. Plus you get the exposure, you know, you might actually get a client because somebody listens to it. So that's my favorite. Yeah. Yeah. Sam Dunning (23:36.79) Yeah, it's great. It is one of the best. I'd probably put that as number one or number two for sure. My other favorite is building partnerships, which again has more holistic business play. So this is finding partners that serve the same ICP, the same idle client profile as you, but are not direct competitors. So as a real example, I partner with a LinkedIn ads agency, Impactable. They serve just like me, B2B service and B2B SaaS clients, but they're not going after SEO clients because they don't offer it. So. John Jantsch (23:44.911) Right. Sam Dunning (24:05.518) I approached their founder guy called Justin a while back and I'm a big fan, John of weird, painfully short messages if I'm trying to get stuff done. So I probably sent you one. I find the founder or the marketing leader on LinkedIn. I'll say something like, Hey Justin had a weird idea to scale your organic traffic and in bounds you against a conversation. He'll probably connect with me on LinkedIn or whatever channel I outreach email, whatever, and say, Sam, what are you on about? But let's hear what you've got to say. Then I'll shoot him like a loom video. John Jantsch (24:30.084) Yeah. Sam Dunning (24:33.006) and just say, look, I've got an idea. In this case, partnership play. The small step initially I might offer is I'll write out a guest blog article for you that will be really useful to your audience. And in return, I just want to link back. And then they might do that and that might grow into, okay, let's do a podcast together. Okay, let's do some more content together. All right, let's start presenting business each other's way. So it's gone from just a small SEO play to like reciprocal business. Just like your podcast is kind of has so much more play to it than just SEO. John Jantsch (25:00.878) Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, Sam, I appreciate you taking a few moments to drop by the duct tape marketing podcast, where would you invite people to connect with you find out more about your work? Sam Dunning (25:09.942) I really appreciate it. Three, three main ways. Really one is LinkedIn. I post ramblings on SEO each and every day. The second is the Breaking B2B podcast where we interview just like this marketing leaders as well as solo episodes on SEO and what's working on marketing today. Or the third is if you're tired of seeing competitors above you and organic search results, stealing traffic inbound leads and more, then we might be able to fix it with our unusual approach to SEO. It's BreakingB2B.com. Happy to chat. John Jantsch (25:37.584) Again, appreciate you stopping by and hopefully we'll run into you one of these days out there on the road. Sam Dunning (25:43.022) Cheers, man. Thank you.","John Jantsch is the founder of Breaking B2B, an SEO firm .

Google,America Needs a New Free Speech Movement,"Activism / Anti-Monopolist / America Needs a New Free Speech Movement Donald Trump is showing us what an unaccountable class of corporate decision-makers looks like—and it looks like a lot of fear, and a terrible loss of freedom.

We are in a full-blown crisis of free speech. Earlier this month, ICE agents detained Mahmoud Khalil, a green-card holder, with plans to deport him because of the content of his speech. Trump banned AP reporters from press briefings after the AP refused to use the phrase “Gulf of America” instead of “Gulf of Mexico” in its style guide. And the administration is following through on threats to withdraw funding from universities that allowed disfavored speech. While Trump will lose in court on many of his efforts, many corporate, university, and nonprofit leaders are quietly obeying in advance, avoiding conflict.

In the 1960s, the Free Speech Movement was a rallying cry for students and activists who understood that the right to dissent, argue, and speak freely was essential to democracy. Today, we need a new Free Speech Movement—and not just a retread of the 1960s. A new free speech movement would recognize that both the direct authoritarian power-grabs of the Trump administration, and the power grabs of private monopolist entities represent a significant danger.Trump’s oligarchs—his big tech allies who control the flow of news and information—are themselves an independent threat to open society.

For decades, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was seen as the gold standard for defending free speech. It stood up for the right of Nazis to march in Skokie, and forcefully argued that the principle of free expression mattered more than the content of any particular speech. But in the past 10 years, several critics—including former executive cirector of the ACLU Ira Glasser—have persuasively argued that the ACLU has compromised or even abandoned those values, choosing cases on the basis of a particular substantive vision, instead of fiercely protecting speech regardless of its content.

One of its most notorious missteps came when a high-level ACLU lawyer argued in favor of getting Amazon to ban a book, saying, “Stopping the circulation of this book and these ideas is 100% a hill I will die on.” This claim was not just a stupid tweet by an activist; it revealed a fundamental and long-standing misunderstanding of how consolidated corporate power threatens free speech.

In the ACLU vision, private power never poses a risk to free expression. If Instagram wants to suppress Palestinian content (as credible reporting suggested it did), that does not implicate democracy, regardless of Instagram’s market share.

When Biden’s DOJ fought to stop a merger between two book publishing goliaths, recognizing that authors having multiple possible outlets is essential to free expression, the ACLU remained silent. Instead, it has repeatedly filed briefs on behalf of Big Tech, defending Silicon Valley’s freedom to act as unaccountable monopolists, claiming that the state has no right to regulate the design of big tech, even if that regulation would make it more content-neutral.

This is not a new phenomenon. The ACLU was one of the driving forces behind Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court case that held that money is speech, and the organization boasts that the ACLU “created much of the constitutional framework that has constrained all federal campaign finance legislation.” It was behind several subsequent challenges to campaign finance laws, and was also a strong supporter of the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United, filing a brief stating that corporations should have the right to spend unlimited money in elections.

Such views reveal the crucial weakness of the 1960s free speech movement—namely, its neoliberal core, that refuses to understand how power works, and understands censorship in a wholly formal way confined to governmental actors.

Even if that approach might have seemed plausible 30 years ago, it has long since passed its sell-by date. Trump’s oligarchy requires us to build a newer, deeper, more principled understanding of free speech—one that sees both government suppression and private censorship as real dangers to democratic debate and human freedom.","Activism / Anti-Monopolist / America Needs a New Free Speech Movement Donald Trump is showing us what an unaccountable class of corporate decision-makers looks like—and it looks like a lot of fear, and a terrible loss of freedom.

Google,"Pebble smartwatches are back: Core 2 Duo & Core Time 2 announced, shipping to Malaysia? Here’s all you need to know","Just less than two months ago, Eric Migicovsky announced his plans to bring Pebble smartwatches back. But I did not expect to find out about the news as soon as yesterday night that the Pebble founder has announced two new smartwatches under his new wearable company – Core Devices. The two smartwatches are known as the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 and are now available for pre-order.

Eric Migicovsky picking up where he left off with Pebble a decade ago

Your eyes aren’t tricking you; these two Core smartwatches are indeed using a similar hardware design as the Pebble 2 that was launched back in 2016. In fact, you can consider the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 as spiritual successors to the Pebble 2 and Pebble Time respectively. Migicovsky even calls the Core Time 2 his “dream watch” and what the Pebble Time 2 was supposed to be.

True to Migicovsky’s promise, these “resurrected” Pebble smartwatches also share many of the features introduced by past Pebble smartwatches. This includes e-paper displays, long battery life, and physical navigation buttons. Both watches also run on PebbleOS which Google open-sourced not too long ago.

If you aren’t familiar with Pebble’s history, the company was acquired by Fitbit in 2016, which was then bought over by Google in 2021. This is also part of the reason why Migicovsky wasn’t able to re-use the Pebble brand as the California-based company still owns the rights to the Pebble name.

Core 2 Duo: Very much like the Pebble 2, but better

Let’s start with the more affordable watch of the two first – the Core 2 Duo. Migicovsky describes this wearable as being highly similar to the Pebble 2 but has now been made better with extra capabilities. At its core, no pun intended, the Core 2 Duo features a polycarbonate frame that can be had in either Black or White.

At the face of the watch, you get a 1.26” black and white e-paper display that pushes out 144 x 168 pixels, resulting in a Dots Per Inch (DPI) count of 176. The watch, along with the Core Time 2 also comes with 22mm straps out of the box, although no specific type of strap has been mentioned. Based on the official images, both models will most probably come with silicone straps as standard.

Standard features offered by the Core watches will include step and sleep tracking, as well as a targeted IPX8 rating for water resistance. As mentioned, both smartwatches, including the Core 2 Duo will run on the open-sourced PebbleOS. But to all of you who are unfamiliar, the OS delivers baseline features such as notifications, Pebble’s timeline interface, watch faces, alarms, timers, calendar, music control, and basic fitness tracking.

So, what are some new features the Core 2 Duo has over the Pebble 2? This consists of features like a microphone and a speaker that are said to be built mainly for apps such as ChatGPT or other AI agent apps. Sadly, handling phone calls isn’t a priority feature here.

The Core 2 Duo will also sport a new linear actuator motor that’s said to be quieter and stronger than a vibrating motor, along with new compass and barometer sensors, and improved hardware navigation buttons that are said to offer up to 30% longer lifetime, at least based on Core Device’s testing.

Even more important here is improved battery life. If you think the Pebble 2 already offered a long enough battery life of up to 7 days, the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 can do up to 4 times more. Yes, that’s up to 30 days of battery life. Migicovsky credits this to how Bluetooth chips’ power efficiency has improved over the last decade.

Core Time 2: All that the Pebble Time 2 was meant to be

Migicovsky calls the Core Time 2 his “dream watch”. It’s what the Pebble Time 2 was meant to be and more. By paying slightly more (more details below) over the Core 2 Duo, you get a larger and more colourful 1.5” 64-colour e-paper display, which is the same display panel seen on the Pebble Time 2.

The resolution for this display is rated at 200 x 228 pixels or 202 DPI. The Time 2 also shares the same design as the Core 2 Duo, albeit with a more premium metal case.

Another bonus you get on the Core Time 2 is the inclusion of a touch screen, which is currently there mainly for you to customise the complications on your watch faces and widgets, much like the full touchscreen smartwatches we have today. You also get a heart rate monitor by splurging for the Time 2.

Pricing, availability, shipment details for Malaysia

Now, price. The Core 2 Duo is retailed at USD 149 (~RM662), while the Core Time 2 is priced at USD 225 (~RM999). Both are currently available for pre-order, with shipments for the Core 2 Duo to begin as early as July 2025. As for the Core Time 2, the first batch of these watches is estimated to start shipping to customers in December 2025, so all of you who are looking at this one will have to be a little bit more patient.

As for colour options, both watches are offered in either Black or White, with a potential third colour option being teased to be made exclusively available for the Core Time 2 at a later date.

I’m happy to report that Core Devices is shipping these watches to Malaysia. But you do have to pay a shipping fee of USD 25 (~RM111), which will be added on top of your watch’s cost.

However, do note that these watches will only be made in limited quantities, mainly due to a limited supply of display inventory. Therefore, Core Devices recommends customers pre-order via its online store to secure their units.

You can build your own app or watch to work with PebbleOS

According to Migicovsky, PebbleOS will come out of the gate with over 10,000 existing watch faces and apps. Most of them will immediately work, though some may try to access web services that no longer exist. You can browse the Rebble website to check out the full list of apps available on the app store. However, existing apps and watch faces will show up with a border on the Core Time 2 due to its larger display, and will stay that way until developers update them.

Speaking of apps, Core Devices will be publishing a companion mobile app for Android and iOS. But due to the open-source nature of PebbleOS, you can create your own app for it if you choose to, or just use Rebble’s app instead. Alternatively, you can even build your own smartwatch and have it run on PebbleOS.

Core smartwatches are made out of labour of love rather than profit in mind, so do expect imperfections

In his blog, Eric Migicovsky states that the Core smartwatch project is a labour of love, rather than a startup attempting to sell millions of watches. Therefore, it’s safe to say that these wearables aren’t for those looking for a perfectly polished smartwatch. They may come with some rough edges and even delays. Some features might not be ready at launch, and things could break or not last as long as you’d like.

Also, these smartwatches aren’t made for those looking for a fitness-focused watch, or an Apple Watch replacement. Due to restrictions Apple has implemented towards third-party accessories, you won’t be able to use smartwatches like those from Core Devices to reply to notifications or take “actions” such as marking something as done.

It’s also impossible to send text messages or iMessage using the Core smartwatches. So to experience the full potential of the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2, it’s best to connect them to an Android phone. If you decide at any point that the watch is not for you, Core Devices’ FAQ states that you can cancel your pre-order and get a full refund any time before your watch ships.

Anyway, are you getting one of these watches for yourself? I’ve been waiting for one of these for almost a decade, so I can’t wait to receive mine later this year.

[SOURCE, VIA]","Just less than two months ago, Eric Migicovsky announced his plans to bring Pebble smartwatches back. But I did not expect to find out about the news as soon as yesterday night that the Pebble founder has announced two new smartwatches under his new wearable company – Core Devices. The two smartwatches are known as the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 and are now available for pre-order. Eric Migicovsky picking up where he left off with Pebble a decade ago Your eyes aren’t tricking you; these two Core smartwatches are indeed using a similar hardware design as the Pebble 2 that was launched back in 2016. In fact, you can consider the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 as spiritual successors to the Pebble 2 and Pebble Time respectively. Migicovsky even calls the Core Time 2 his “dream watch” and what the Pebble Time 2 was supposed to be. True to Migicovsky’s promise, these “resurrected” Pebble smartwatches also share many of the features introduced by past Pebble smartwatches. This includes e-paper displays, long battery life, and physical navigation buttons. Both watches also run on PebbleOS which Google open-sourced not too long ago. If you aren’t familiar with Pebble’s history, the company was acquired by Fitbit in 2016, which was then bought over by Google in 2021. This is also part of the reason why Migicovsky wasn’t able to re-use the Pebble brand as the California-based company still owns the rights to the Pebble name. Core 2 Duo: Very much like the Pebble 2, but better Let’s start with the more affordable watch of the two first – the Core 2 Duo. Migicovsky describes this wearable as being highly similar to the Pebble 2 but has now been made better with extra capabilities. At its core, no pun intended, the Core 2 Duo features a polycarbonate frame that can be had in either Black or White. At the face of the watch, you get a 1.26” black and white e-paper display that pushes out 144 x 168 pixels, resulting in a Dots Per Inch (DPI) count of 176. The watch, along with the Core Time 2 also comes with 22mm straps out of the box, although no specific type of strap has been mentioned. Based on the official images, both models will most probably come with silicone straps as standard. Standard features offered by the Core watches will include step and sleep tracking, as well as a targeted IPX8 rating for water resistance. As mentioned, both smartwatches, including the Core 2 Duo will run on the open-sourced PebbleOS. But to all of you who are unfamiliar, the OS delivers baseline features such as notifications, Pebble’s timeline interface, watch faces, alarms, timers, calendar, music control, and basic fitness tracking.

Google,"Microsoft Discovers Remote Access Trojan (RAT) That Targets Crypto Wallets like Coinbase, Metamask","Advertisement

Microsoft Incident Response analysts discovered a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) named StilachiRAT. The malware steals sensitive credentials and targets cryptocurrency wallets. It is particularly skilled at avoiding detection and has various features, including advanced persistence capabilities and command-and-control protocols.

StilachiRAT monitors Google Chrome local data and scans the clipboard for sensitive information. According to Microsoft, the malware has various anti-forensics features, such as clearing logs and checking whether it is contained in a sandbox. Microsoft does not know who is behind the malware but insists that more knowledge about the RAT will protect consumers.

“In November 2024”, according to the Microsoft security blog, “Microsoft Incident Response researchers uncovered a novel remote access trojan (RAT) we named StilachiRAT that demonstrates sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment, and exfiltrate sensitive data”.

“Analysis of the StilachiRAT’s WWStartupCtrl64.dll module that contains the RAT capabilities revealed the use of various methods to steal information from the target system, such as credentials stored in the browser, digital wallet information, data stored in the clipboard, as well as system information”.

StilachiRAT can scan the network and travel between devices. The malware pretends to be an authorised Microsoft service, thus thwarting attempts to discover what it is doing. It can also impersonate users, gain access to systems, and use such credentials to attack more systems.

When installed on a compromised system, the malware can scan configuration data from 20 different cryptocurrency wallets, including the Coinbase wallet, Metamask wallet, and OKX wallet.

According to the Microsoft blog, “The communications channel “is established using TCP ports 53, 443, or 16000, selected randomly. Additionally, the malware checks for the presence of tcpview.exe and will not proceed if one is present.“

“It also delays initial connection by two hours, presumably to evade detection. Once connected, a list of active windows is sent to the server”.

StilachiRAT then gains “persistence” by using Windows Service Control Manager (SCM) to monitor the malware’s binaries and reinstall them if they become inactive. The malware runs the programs using either a standalone process or a Windows service.

“Precomputed API checksums,” according to the Microsoft blog, “are stored in multiple lookup tables, each masked with an XOR value. During the launch, the malware selects the appropriate table based on the hashed API name, applies the correct XOR mask to decode the value, and dynamically resolves the corresponding Windows API function”.

“The resolved function pointer is then cached, but with an additional XOR mask applied, preventing straightforward memory scans from identifying API references.”

StilachiRAT also targets RDP servers to mimic users and spread throughout the network. The malware can clone security tokens and monitor data from open windows, aiming to remain undetected for as long as possible.

Microsoft may use this information further to replace Chrome with Edge, their in-house browser. They claim that Edge can better protect your data by using SmartScreen to filter malicious websites, malware, and phishing attempts.

Google executives have noticed the campaign aims to lure Chrome users to Edge. It is good to understand the corporate interests that underlie a security warning, especially from a company like Microsoft, which is currently fighting a browser war against Chrome. They may further try to patch their browser without sharing information with Chrome to secure more market dominance.","Advertisement Microsoft Incident Response analysts discovered a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) named StilachiRAT.

Google,Nvidia senior engineer explains why many employees don't talk about their equity,"Justin Fung, a senior engineer at Nvidia, says employees don't talk about their equity's worth.

He said in an interview with ""Codesmith"" that Nvidia is largely made up of long-time staffers.

Fung said he landed his own role by developing a niche set of skills.

Nvidia is still staffed largely by the ""old guard"" — and they're not paying much attention to the company's recent rise to popularity.

So says Justin Fung, a senior engineer at the company, who doesn't believe external interest is having much of an effect on Nvidia's culture.

""People don't really talk about how much their equity is worth, because they were never really there for the equity,"" Fung said in an interview with the ""Codesmith"" podcast. ""They really just liked what they were doing.""

Nvidia has gained fame as one of the leading companies driving the AI boom, but before that, despite enjoying relatively consistent success in the GPU space, it wasn't a household name.

""It's a really interesting company because it only became famous in the last five years,"" Fung said. The initial broader spark of interest from the outside world, he added, came thanks to the gold rush on crypto.

""People realized that you could mine Bitcoin using these computers,"" he said. ""So, that was the first step into the public consciousness — and then the next big one was obviously AI. People figured out that you could run these neural networks on these GPUs, and that sent it to the stratosphere.""

With its explosion in popularity has come a corresponding spike in employee compensation — with Nvidia's median salary surpassing $220,000 as of 2024. For Fung, having a role at Nvidia represented a turnaround in his finances.

""Everybody knows the equity, the stock has risen exponentially over the last couple of years,"" Fung said. ""I'm in a very comfortable place compared to where I used to be.""

Fung said Nvidia doesn't have high turnover, so many of his coworkers are holdovers from when the company was primarily associated with the gaming industry. They're lifers who joined — and stayed — largely thanks to their passion for the work.

""A lot of people have been working there before this company was famous, and they'd make gaming rigs,"" Fung said. ""A lot of people that come from that era are very humble, just from a previous generation of technology.""

In fact, unless it's intern season, Fung said younger employees are a relatively rare sight.

""Everybody's super nice and I love all my co-workers, but I don't think the turnover is as high, so you don't see a lot of younger millennials or Gen Z people there,"" he said.

Unlike many of its peers in the tech field, Fung said Nvidia never really developed a ""startup"" culture. Instead, he added, CEO Jensen Huang's vision for the company has remained relatively consistent since its inception.

""Nvidia, despite being as popular as it was, never really had the culture of being a startup — say Airbnb or Snapchat — where there's a lot of young people having fun and doing work at the same time,"" Fung said.""

And unlike other big names in tech like Google or Facebook, Nvidia isn't in the business of hiring ""generalists"" and plugging them in wherever they fit, Fung said. Instead, they're often looking for people with hyper-specific skillsets.

""I really only got the position though, because my alignment, my background, was like perfectly aligned with the role,"" Fung said. And I have seen a lot of people apply to Nvidia who were not as lucky.""

Nvidia didn't respond to a request for comment by Business Insider prior to publication.","Justin Fung, a senior engineer at Nvidia, says employees don't talk about their equity's worth.

Google,Royal Enfield Bear 650 Review; Modern Classic Scrambler Or City Slicker?,"What I like about scrambler motorcycles are the fact that they are lean, mean and versatile. They can be the only motorcycles in your garage and do almost everything that you want a motorcycle to do. So, it's been a while in coming, but we finally had the chance to ride the Royal Enfield Bear 650, based on the Interceptor 650 of course. It looks rugged and purpose-built but does it have the goods to be the best 650 cc bike from Royal Enfield? About time we find out.

What is the Bear 650 All About?

Well, it is what Royal Enfield calls a 'street scrambler'. A scrambler that is meant primarily to be ridden on the road but will indulge if you want to hit some mild trails on the weekend. Dual-purpose tyres, a slight increase in suspension travel, a two-in-1 exhaust and a fresh appeal makes it significantly different from the Interceptor 650.

What Are The Design and Features On The Bear 650 Like?

What I quite like is the way the motorcycle looks. The retro-scrambler flavour is apparent with the lean-mean stance of the motorcycle, chunky tyres with block pattern treads, ribbed seat and the classic round headlight. Putting aside function, for a minute, the form on the Bear 650 is definitely a head-turner. While it may not have the visual mass of a Super Meteor 650 or the Shotgun 650, in my opinion, it is easily the best-looking motorcycle from RE's 650 cc parallel-twin range.

In terms of features, the Bear 650 gets the same circular TFT console which we have seen on the Himalayan and the Guerrilla 450, with Google Maps integration. You can turn off the rear ABS for some off-road fun and the Bear is also the first 650 cc RE to get full LED lighting.

What Kind Of Ergonomics & Dimensions Does The Bear 650 Have?

So, the Bear 650 weighs in at 216 kg, it has a seat height of 830 mm, and the ground clearance stands at 184 mm. The handlebar is nice and wide and the seating position is almost upright with just a hint of sportiness. The seat itself is comfy and supportive. But yes, if you want to muscle it out of a parking lot or if you are shorter than 5 feet 8 inches, then you will have to get used to the tall seat and the weight of the motorcycle.

What Are The Engine Specifications Like?

The Bear 650 continues to get the same 648 cc air and oil-cooled parallel-twin engine making 46.8 hp at 7,150 rpm while the peak torque output is 56.5 Nm coming in at 5,150 rpm. Now, the torque output is around 4.5 Nm more than what the other 650 cc RE models offer. And the increase in torque is felt across the rev range. The engine is paired to a 6-speed gearbox with a slip and assist clutch.

How Is The Performance Like On The Bear 650?

The improvement in performance is more than just incremental. Thanks to the 2-in-1 exhaust, the pull from the engine feels more urgent and the motorcycle builds up speed quickly. Overtaking is a breezy affair and there is more than enough power on tap in the mid-range and at the top too. The engine feels refined and what I really liked is the way the motorcycle sounds. It has a nice burble and growl to it. The 6-speed gearbox offers smooth shifts but at times moving from 1st to 2nd gear and finding the neutral isn't all that smooth.

What Kind Of Chassis & Cycle Parts Does The Bear 650 Get?

The Bear 650 gets some reinforcement on the chassis, at the headstock and the sub-frame, which makes it tougher than the other RE 650 models. Also, the swingarm on the Bear 650 is 60 mm longer than that of the Interceptor 650, making it a bigger motorcycle. The front suspension consists of a 43 mm Showa USD fork with 130 mm travel while the rear gets twin shock absorbers with 115 mm of travel.

How Does The Bear 650 Ride & Handle?

You do feel the heft of the Bear 650 when you want to make quick direction changes but the motorcycle feels sure-footed and holds its line when leaned over. There is no drama and the MRF Nylorex tyres offer good grip despite being dual-purpose. But where the motorcycle falls short is the ride. The suspension is stiff and the damping could have been better. The rear suspension in particular is stiff and if you ride over broken patches of road, you will feel the rear bouncing which doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. On smooth roads, the Bear 650 feels planted.

What Kind Of Off-Road Performance Does It Offer?

The Bear 650 is a hoot to ride on mild trails. There is plenty of torque to get the rear wheel spinning and sliding and with the rear ABS deactivated, you can have some fun too. But the stiff suspension and the inconsistency means, the motorcycle is limited in its capability. The front fork tends to bottom out and the rear suspension's stiffness means the jolts feel more pronounced than you would like them too.

What About The Pricing and Rivals Of The Bear 650?

Prices for the Bear 650 start at Rs. 3.39 lakh, going up to Rs. 3.59 lakh (ex-showroom), depending on the colour option that you choose. The motorcycle doesn't have a direct rival, but in case you want a scrambler that is more affordable and offers more or less similar performance, then you can look at the Royal Enfield Scram 440 and the Triumph Scrambler 400 X.

Final Say On The Royal Enfield Bear 650

So, the big question! Is it the best 650 cc RE you can buy? In my mind, yes! But that is only because I like scrambler/ADV motorcycles. If your preferred flavour in motorcycles is different, then the Super Meteor 650 and the Interceptor 650 make sense too. But when you consider the Bear 650 as an overall package, the looks, the performance and the features, then, it offers the best value-for-money among all of Royal Enfield's 650 cc motorcycles.



Photography: Azam Siddiqui","What I like about scrambler motorcycles are the fact that they are lean, mean and versatile. They can be the only motorcycles in your garage and do almost everything that you want a motorcycle to do. So, it's been a while in coming, but we finally had the chance to ride the Royal Enfield Bear 650, based on the Interceptor 650 of course. It looks rugged and purpose-built but does it have the goods to be the best 650 cc bike from Royal Enfield? About time we find out. What is the Bear 650 All About? Well, it is what Royal Enfield calls a 'street scrambler'. A scrambler that is meant primarily to be ridden on the road but will indulge if you want to hit some mild trails on the weekend. Dual-purpose tyres, a slight increase in suspension travel, a two-in-1 exhaust and a fresh appeal makes it significantly different from the Interceptor 650. What Are The Design and Features On The Bear 650 Like? What I quite like is the way the motorcycle looks. The retro-scrambler flavour is apparent with the lean-mean stance of the motorcycle, chunky tyres with block pattern treads, ribbed seat and the classic round headlight. Putting aside function, for a minute, the form on the Bear 650 is definitely a head-turner. While it may not have the visual mass of a Super Meteor 650 or the Shotgun 650, in my opinion, it is easily the best-looking motorcycle from RE's 650 cc parallel-twin range. In terms of features, the Bear 650 gets the same circular TFT console which we have seen on the Himalayan and the Guerrilla 450, with Google Maps integration. You can turn off the rear ABS for some off-road fun and the Bear is also the first 650 cc RE to get full LED lighting. What Kind Of Ergonomics & Dimensions Does The Bear 650 Have? So, the Bear 650 weighs in at 216 kg, it has a seat height of 830 mm, and the ground clearance stands at 184 mm. The handlebar is nice and wide and the seating position is almost upright with just a hint of sportiness. The seat itself is comfy and supportive. But yes, if you want to muscle it out of a parking lot or if you are shorter than 5 feet 8 inches, then you will have to get used to the tall seat and the weight of the motorcycle. What Are The Engine Specifications Like? The Bear 650 continues to get the same 648 cc air and oil-cooled parallel-twin engine making 46.8 hp at 7,150 rpm while the peak torque output is 56.5 Nm coming in at 5,150 rpm. Now, the torque output is around 4.5 Nm more than what the other 650 cc RE models offer. And the increase in torque is felt across the rev range. The engine is paired to a 6-speed gearbox with a slip and assist clutch. How Is The Performance Like On The Bear 650? The improvement in performance is more than just incremental. Thanks to the 2-in-1 exhaust, the pull from the engine feels more urgent and the motorcycle builds up speed quickly. Overtaking is a breezy affair and there is more than enough power on tap in the mid-range and at the top too. The engine feels refined and what I really liked is the way the motorcycle sounds. It has a nice burble and growl to it. The 6-speed gearbox offers smooth shifts but at times moving from 1st to 2nd gear and finding the neutral isn't all that smooth. What Kind Of Chassis & Cycle Parts Does The Bear 650 Get? The Bear 650 gets some reinforcement on the chassis, at the headstock and the sub-frame, which makes it tougher than the other RE 650 models. Also, the swingarm on the Bear 650 is 60 mm longer than that of the Interceptor 650, making it a bigger motorcycle. The front suspension consists of a 43 mm Showa USD fork with 130 mm travel while the rear gets twin shock absorbers with 115 mm of travel. How Does The Bear 650 Ride & Handle? You do feel the heft of the Bear 650 when you want to make quick direction changes but the motorcycle feels sure-footed and holds its line when leaned over. There is no drama and the MRF Nylorex tyres offer good grip despite being dual-purpose. But where the motorcycle falls short is the ride. The suspension is stiff and the damping could have been better. The rear suspension in particular is stiff and if you ride over broken patches of road, you will feel the rear bouncing which doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. On smooth roads, the Bear 650 feels planted. What Kind Of Off-Road Performance Does It Offer? The Bear 650 is a hoot to ride on mild trails. There is plenty of torque to get the rear wheel spinning and sliding and with the rear ABS deactivated, you can have some fun too. But the stiff suspension and the inconsistency means, the motorcycle is limited in its capability. The front fork tends to bottom out and the rear suspension's stiffness means the jolts feel more pronounced than you would like them too. What About The Pricing and Rivals Of The Bear 650? Prices for the Bear 650 start at Rs. 3.39 lakh, going up to Rs. 3.59 lakh (ex-showroom), depending on the colour option that you choose. The motorcycle doesn't have a direct rival, but in case you want a scrambler that is more affordable and offers more or less similar performance, then you can look at the Royal Enfield Scram 440 and the Triumph Scrambler 400 X. Final Say On The Royal Enfield Bear 650 So, the big question! Is it the best 650 cc RE you can buy? In my mind, yes! But that is only because I like scrambler/ADV motorcycles. If your preferred flavour in motorcycles is different, then the Super Meteor 650 and the Interceptor 650 make sense too. But when you consider the Bear 650 as an overall package, the looks, the performance and the features, then, it offers the best value-for-money among all of Royal Enfield's 650 cc motorcycles.

I’m not worried about AI taking my blogging job

I was thinking the other day about blogs that are largely informational, such as travel blogs.

You know, the type that list the top ten attractions in Honolulu, or the best hikes in Arizona. These kinds of blogs largely depend on search traffic….random people typing in search terms on Google and then landing on the blog.

If I wrote one of those blogs, I would be feeling nervous because AI can write a pretty decent informational post.

But mercifully, not a lot of my traffic comes from Google searches! A very, very high percentage of my traffic just comes from you guys typing in my blog address and visiting here every day.

Also, the kind of blogging I do is very individualized; I have a hard time imagining AI could produce content that reflects my personality or that tells the story of a life like mine does.

So. I’m not losing sleep over this. 🙂

About motivation

My hospital work has gotten me thinking about motivation. It is interesting to see the variations in people’s levels of health motivation. Some people are raring to go after surgery, ready to work with PT, ready to push through, anxious to get to rehab and regain independence.

And some people are just the opposite.

I know I’m still new in the field:

…but even I can look at a motivated patient and feel pretty sure that a speedy recovery is in their future. The motivation and associated effort make such a huge difference.

This is an interesting thing to ponder because as healthcare workers, we can only do so much to help a patient. We can offer treatment, education, assistance, and resources, but if we could also give a pill of motivation, it would make all the difference in the world.

I wish recipes came with samples

I have thought so many times that I would love it if there was technology that gave you a little sample bite of a recipe before you try making it.

Somebody needs to invent this because it would save us all so much time. Imagine how many lackluster recipes we would avoid this way!

Also, this would have saved me from some questionable high-protein recipes. Ha.

If you have Instagram, you can watch the story of my failed protein cookie. 😉

I have concluded cookies are not supposed to be high-protein. 😉 Some things are just meant to be treats.

Jalapeño Everything Bagel Seasoning: 10/10

I picked up a bottle of this at Aldi and oooh it is so tasty! So good sprinkled on eggs, and it costs $1.59 at my Aldi.

I bought some bunny earrings

I will be at clinical on the Saturday and Sunday of Easter weekend and I usually try to wear some holiday-themed earrings because my little older lady patients appreciate these just as much as pediatric patients. 😉

I have fall earrings and some Christmas earrings now, but I had no Easter ones. So, I ordered a little pair from Etsy.

Do you wanna come to an in-real-life meetup?

Last year reader PD organized an in-person meet up, and she volunteered to do that again this year.

It’ll be the same low-key setup as before (we all brought picnic lunches!) and if you are interested in joining us, here’s a Google form to fill out, where you can vote on a date that sounds good to you.

Further details will be shared privately via email, using the email address you submit on the form.

Google,Apple is becoming a utility. That's hard for fanboys to take.,"Sales of iPhones have been flat for a decade, and Siri has sucked for about as long.

And yet, Apple has added roughly trillions of dollars in market value during that time.

It's time to think of Apple as more like a utility.

It's time to think differently about Apple.

The company is becoming a utility, which is hard for fanboys to accept, though it's not all bad.

The iPhone has become the standard tool for accessing online data and running our lives. Most owners don't care about cutting-edge AI or the latest speedy chip. They just need the device to keep working.

Apple fans have been aflutter lately over the company's decision to postpone new AI features, with some analysts predicting lower iPhone sales as a result.

That may be important for a tiny fraction of customers, such as Apple bloggers and the odd person who absolutely needs the latest and greatest iPhone. For everyone else, we don't care. We mostly want the battery to last all day, our apps to run, our texts to go through, and a camera to just work. This can be done with any iPhone, and it doesn't need AI.

Similar to an electric utility, we rely on the iPhone a lot. Most of us don't think about it passionately until something goes wrong. That's usually the battery degrading. Or when Apple updates the operating system, and a few older iPhones no longer work. Or you damage it beyond repair, or it gets stolen.

This drives an iPhone upgrade cycle that has become incredibly powerful and has little to do with fancy new AI features. Eventually, every one of the roughly 1.5 billion iPhones out there will have to be replaced.

""300 million iPhones have not upgraded in over four years,"" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote recently in an email to Business Insider. ""That's a lot of pent-up demand.""

This is the main driver of iPhone sales now. It's not that sexy, and it's not high growth. Instead, it's big and steady, like a utility.

A chart showing iPhone unit sales. Dan Morgan, Synovus, and data compiled by Bloomberg. Red = estimate.

The chart above, based on data compiled by Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus, indicates that iPhone sales have flatlined for a decade.

That might seem bad. But Apple shares have soared sevenfold in the past decade, massively outperforming the broader stock market. It's the most valuable public company in the world. By a lot.

During that same time, Siri — Apple's main AI offering — has sucked pretty hard. How much did that derail the iPhone upgrade train? Not much, judging by the data above.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

Why Warren Buffett likes utilities and Apple

Warren Buffett, a massive utility investor, remains one of Apple's largest shareholders. In his latest letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he listed Apple alongside other unsexy, non-AI companies, such as American Express, Coca-Cola, and Moody's.

He seems blissfully uninterested in the latest whizz-bang Apple technology and how that might help sell more iPhones in a given quarter.

""The idea that spending loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X or whatever are going to be sold in a given three-month period, to me, it totally misses the point,"" Buffett said in 2018.

Buffett likes Apple for similar reasons he loves utilities and other vaguely boring, profitable companies. Many people need what these companies sell, which helps them generate large, reliable returns — including juicy dividends.

'Panic' on the streets of Silicon Valley

A panicked human. Where's his iPhone? izusek/Getty Images

Electricity. Water. An iPhone. These are essential ingredients for modern life. Without them, things can get difficult quickly. Take my family's experience as an example.

My wife's iPhone was stolen last year. She waited only a few hours before driving to the nearest Apple store to hand over almost $1,000 for a replacement. She described the thought of existing without an iPhone as ""panic.""

First up: She used two-factor authentication via her iPhone to access sensitive work documents. She couldn't work without a new Apple device. (She's added a backup now. Guess what it is? An iPad!)

Then, a long list of other practical tasks revealed themselves to be difficult without an iPhone: booking an exercise class, texting a group of friends, keeping streaks going on mobile games, and accessing the iPhone's digital wallet for tickets she needed soon.

My daughter broke her iPhone beyond repair last year. She experienced similar panic and bought a replacement from Apple within 24 hours.

She uses a mobile app on her iPhone to authenticate and access her college accounts for submitting homework and doing other study-related stuff. She also had a plane to catch and was worried about not having the digital ticket.

Both my wife and my daughter worried about the data on their iPhones and thought it would be safer and easier to get a new iPhone to reclaim this digital information.

This year, my iPhone SE's battery started running low, and I struggled to hear people well on phone calls. These problems were fixable and probably related to user error. I could have gotten a new battery from Apple, for instance, yet I just could not be bothered. So I bought a new iPhone 16e. It was so easy, and my life was uninterrupted. I did not think about AI once during this process.

Android switching doesn't really happen anymore

My wife, my daughter, and I did not ever once consider getting an Android phone instead. For many nontechnical consumers, switching is too complex.

My wife knew her stolen iPhone was backed up in Apple's iCloud, so getting the same device again made the replacement process much quicker and smoother.

""I knew that if I bought another one, it would be as painless as possible to access my photos, wallet, apps, contacts, etc.,"" she told me. ""I was already pained by the stolen iPhone. Switching to Android at that moment made no sense. I'd have been breaking myself into jail.""

A 2023 study by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated that only about 4% of Android phone buyers switched from an iPhone. The authors wrote that a big reason was ""fear of the complexity of switching.""

""There's not a lot of iOS-to-Android switching,"" said Josh Lowitz, a partner at CIRP. ""Switching between platforms is not that difficult, but the habits and iOS-specific apps and connections are hard to leave.""

This is why a year or so of delay in AI features won't matter much. When an iPhone stops working, its owner will almost certainly buy another, with or without AI.

So we should watch: How many old iPhones will Apple stop supporting? The company does an amazing job keeping these devices running for years. But after a certain point, the hardware just can't keep up.

That's when some handsets are dropped from iOS. Later this year, probably in September, Apple will do this again, and millions of people will have to pay to upgrade — just as I have to keep paying PG&E to pump electricity and natural gas into my house.

All is not lost

This is a long way from the cutting-edge technology that Apple fanboys love to nerd out about. There hasn't been much to get excited about lately on that front. Apple scrapped its car project. The Vision Pro mixed-reality goggles have flopped so far. And now, these AI delays show how far Apple lags behind Google, Meta, and OpenAI.

All is not lost, though. If Apple were a true utility, regulators would cap what it charges customers, which would probably crush the stock.

Instead, Apple can charge what it wants for iPhones. Take the latest example. The cheapest version of the new iPhone 16e costs $170 more than the last entry-level iPhone, the SE. That's 40% inflation in the base cost to access your digital life.

""Without a new iPhone SE, current iPhone SE owners will likely hold on to their phones a little longer,"" said CIRP's Lowitz. ""When they need to get a new phone, they will likely buy the most affordable new iPhone.""

What an incredible business. No wonder Apple has become the world's most valuable company — with or without AI.","Sales of iPhones have been flat for a decade, and Siri has sucked for about as long.

Google,Tech employees are getting the message: Play time's over,"A trifecta of economics, pandemic-era realities, and political pressure is changing tech culture.

From Big Tech to Silicon Valley startups, companies are pushing to ""do more with less.""

Leaders aren't shy about wielding their power and aligning around a hard-driving strategy.

For years, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke enjoyed a reputation for growing the $125 billion e-commerce company without working the grueling hours expected of startup founders.

""My job is incredible, but it's also just a job. Family and personal health rank higher in my priority list,"" he wrote in a now-deleted post on X, then Twitter, shortly before the pandemic, as reported by Business Insider at the time. ""The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so.""

This year, even Lütke appeared to change his tune.

""I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend,"" Lütke wrote on X. He was responding to a user who called him a ""counter-example"" to a meme suggesting you can't have work-life balance and a breakthrough startup. ""I don't want people to get misguided by this meme.""

Across tech, the tables have turned for employees as performance pressure and proclamations of ""efficiency"" and ""intensity"" replace perks and pampering. Sweeping layoffs have become the norm in an industry that, in recent memory, enjoyed job security. The pressure to dominate in AI has created intense competition, as companies use the technology to do more with fewer workers. Already hard-driving workplaces have become even harder.

While the situation for tech employees has been changing since the pandemic boom ended in 2022, more recent developments include a decidedly different tone from executives. Now, companies aren't just making these changes; they want to be seen making them.

Elon Musk's slash-and-burn tactics are now being embraced by Silicon Valley in the name of efficiency. At Twitter, Musk cut 80% of the staff — over 6,000 people. Years later, the company didn't collapse as some feared. And now, Musk's outsized influence on President Donald Trump and his administration has empowered both him and his cut throat strategies. CEOs of the biggest tech giants are following suit with similar tactics.

Meta earlier this year said it was cutting 4,000 employees deemed low performers as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the ""culturally neutered"" corporate world had gotten away from ""masculine energy."" Amazon insisted that employees return to the workplace every weekday, a policy some employees say is stricter than before the pandemic.

Other companies have cracked down, too. Microsoft, which was once referred to as a ""country club"" for its relatively lax culture, cut 2,000 employees as it overhauled its review process to eliminate underperformers more quickly.

Google, which practically invented tech perks like free lunch, started an ""efficiency drive."" Its cofounder Sergey Brin, who had stepped away from leading Google but now often shows up to work on the company's Gemini AI models, recently recommended that employees working on its Gemini tools should work 60 hours a week and go into the office ""at least every weekday."" Wall Street has rewarded this rigor, as stock prices of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's parent, Alphabet, have surged since 2022.

Startups also see a trickle-down effect from Big Tech companies' pressures. Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures, said he had noticed a ""pronounced shift"" toward leaner teams and rigorous performance standards at startups.

Between performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, it's clear not only that the tech industry is done coddling employees, but that companies want to send the message those days are over. BI interviewed employees from tech giants, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, as well as various tech startups, about the changes. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity since they're not authorized to talk to the press, though their identities are known to BI.

From comfy to collapsed

For years, fierce competition for tech workers meant companies spoiled employees with astonishing salaries and swanky perks, such as in-office massages and free food cooked by fancy chefs.

By 2022, tech companies seemingly couldn't throw enough money at workers. Early that year, Amazon more than doubled its maximum base salary, and Microsoft gave across-the-board raises to employees up to a certain level of seniority to dissuade them from leaving for competitors.

As the pandemic boom ended, tech stocks plummeted, and interest rates increased through 2022. This prompted an efficiency drive by many companies as investors demanded profitability over growth at all costs.

Also that year, companies watched the billionaire Elon Musk's handling of the Twitter acquisition, in which he cut thousands of employees, plus perks like free lunches, and demanded a commitment to a new ""extremely hardcore"" vision and ""long hours at a high intensity."" At one point, Twitter workers were begging on Slack for toilet paper and clean bathrooms amid Musk's drastic cost-cutting.

As of late last year, Fidelity valued X at only about 20% of the $44 billion that Musk bought it for in 2022. Still, his approach may have expanded what the tech industry thought possible in terms of workforce and cost cutting.

""People paid attention because the prevailing wisdom was you couldn't take out that much of an engineering organization and put that much instability on it and not have it fall over,"" Brad Porter, the founder and CEO of Cobot, told BI. ""It did come close to falling. He pushed right to the edge of it actually falling over, but it didn't fall over.""

'Do more with less'

By the end of 2022 and in early 2023, tech giants had conducted unprecedented rounds of layoffs. Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft collectively laid off more than 60,000 employees during that time.

Layoffs have remained at a steady drip across the industry since. Such cuts have become so frequent at Google, for example, that employees have taken to crowdsourcing information on layoffs in an internal Google Doc.

Employees told BI about the pressure across the industry to ""do more with less."" ""There's lots of uncertainty,"" one longtime Amazon employee said, ""and lots of pressure to perform the jobs of multiple people at the mercy of ruthless middle management.""

Tech companies are also culling middle management layers. Amazon in September announced a plan to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% by the end of this month. In December, CEO Sundar Pichai told his staff that Google had cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of its efficiency drive. Microsoft also monitors what it calls ""span of control,"" tracking the number of reports per manager.

Performance pressures

Amid the cuts, employees across the industry say companies are dialing up the performance demands.

Meta told its staff in January that it would eliminate roughly 5% of its workforce, or about 4,000 employees, to ""raise the bar on performance management,"" as Zuckerberg wrote in an internal memo.

Google also increased pressure on employees. Perhaps most telling was Pichai's December comments attempting to clarify what ""Googleyness"" means for a modern Google. Once a squishy and vague philosophy for the search giant's corporate culture, Pichai said he believed it now meant, among other things, being ""mission first.""

""There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days,"" a longtime Google manager said.

""We're being asked to do more for less,"" said another current longtime Google employee.

That same Google employee said that Silicon Valley had been moving toward more ruthless, efficient workplaces for a while — and that the current political climate ""gives them the green light to do it openly."" Google has been working to become more efficient since its chief investment officer Ruth Porat joined the company as CFO from Morgan Stanley in 2015, ""but now the masks are off,"" the person said.

Microsoft was once referred to as the tech industry's ""country club,"" meaning a place employees would go after they were done working hard in their careers and wanted to coast before retirement. A change this year shows how far Microsoft has shifted when it fired 2,000 employees deemed low performers without severance and ended their health benefits the same day. This kind of performance-based mass cut showed a shift for the tech giant.

One longtime Microsoft senior-level employee said they felt that the ""culture shifts toward firmer performance expectations"" at peer tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon made it more acceptable for Microsoft to do the same.

At TikTok, the pressure to perform jumped last year after the company directed managers to deliver more low scores in performance reviews, leading to PIPs and eventual exits. At the same time, six current and former employees told BI their goals had become much harder to hit. One staffer called the goals ""unattainable.""

The company has also recently heightened RTO requirements for some teams. In February, it told its US e-commerce workers that in addition to being in the office five days a week, they would physically need to be in the building for eight hours a day. Ten current and former workers told BI that burnout had become common, leading to some going on mental health leave to get a break. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.

""You feel like if you're not hitting a target, even if it's a moving target, you're in trouble,"" a former staffer who went on leave for mental health reasons told BI. ""For me, it was just feeling like a failure, like I couldn't do anything right.""

It's gotten hardcore in the 'valley of death'

The increasing pivot to performance has even made it to already hard-charging startups.

Startups have a time-honored tradition of an always-on, work-first lifestyle. Early employees are expected to put in grueling hours of coding and customer support during this critical phase, known as the ""valley of death,"" when startups are flush with initial funding but not yet profitable.

The free-money era tested this tradition of hustle and thriftiness. Investors heaped money into small startups when interest rates bottomed out, and the blitz scaling that followed set off an arms race of perks to help startups attract top talent. Employees could work from home and set their own schedules. They pocketed wellness stipends and trotted the globe on extravagant off-sites. The tech startup Bolt gave many employees Fridays off.

""I think many individuals — founders included — lost sight of the true goal of a company. It is to make money,"" Mang-Git Ng, the founder of Anvil, a paperwork automation company, told BI.

Now, the executives who had lavished high salaries and fancy perks on their employees are resetting expectations, winding down remote work, and cutting head count.

""Everyone who comes into our office at Decagon has opted into working with a team that's here because we want to do big things and see bigger and better results,"" said Jesse Zhang, the founder of Decagon, who now badges into the office six days a week. ""There's no such thing as a rocketship that doesn't have a certain level of intensity to fuel its trajectory.""

Call it the Big Tech trickle-down effect.

""Founders aren't sugarcoating it,"" said Natan Fisher, who runs a recruiting firm, SingleSprout, that specializes in hiring technical talent. ""I've had a few cofounders tell employees they aren't working hard enough, and, 'If you're not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can't slow down.' Late nights, weekends, even people crashing at the office, it's real.""

Emma Cosgrove, Eugene Kim, and Pranav Dixit contributed to this report.","A trifecta of economics, pandemic-era realities, and political pressure is changing tech culture. From Big Tech to Silicon Valley startups, companies are pushing to ""do more with less."" Leaders aren't shy about wielding their power and aligning around a hard-driving strategy. For years, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke enjoyed a reputation for growing the $125 billion e-commerce company without working the grueling hours expected of startup founders. ""My job is incredible, but it's also just a job. Family and personal health rank higher in my priority list,"" he wrote in a now-deleted post on X, then Twitter, shortly before the pandemic, as reported by Business Insider at the time. ""The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so."" This year, even Lütke appeared to change his tune. ""I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend,"" Lütke wrote on X. He was responding to a user who called him a ""counter-example"" to a meme suggesting you can't have work-life balance and a breakthrough startup. ""I don't want people to get misguided by this meme."" Across tech, the tables have turned for employees as performance pressure and proclamations of ""efficiency"" and ""intensity"" replace perks and pampering. Sweeping layoffs have become the norm in an industry that, in recent memory, enjoyed job security. The pressure to dominate in AI has created intense competition, as companies use the technology to do more with fewer workers. Already hard-driving workplaces have become even harder. While the situation for tech employees has been changing since the pandemic boom ended in 2022, more recent developments include a decidedly different tone from executives. Now, companies aren't just making these changes; they want to be seen making them. Elon Musk's slash-and-burn tactics are now being embraced by Silicon Valley in the name of efficiency. At Twitter, Musk cut 80% of the staff — over 6,000 people. Years later, the company didn't collapse as some feared. And now, Musk's outsized influence on President Donald Trump and his administration has empowered both him and his cut throat strategies. CEOs of the biggest tech giants are following suit with similar tactics. Meta earlier this year said it was cutting 4,000 employees deemed low performers as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the ""culturally neutered"" corporate world had gotten away from ""masculine energy."" Amazon insisted that employees return to the workplace every weekday, a policy some employees say is stricter than before the pandemic. Other companies have cracked down, too. Microsoft, which was once referred to as a ""country club"" for its relatively lax culture, cut 2,000 employees as it overhauled its review process to eliminate underperformers more quickly. Google, which practically invented tech perks like free lunch, started an ""efficiency drive."" Its cofounder Sergey Brin, who had stepped away from leading Google but now often shows up to work on the company's Gemini AI models, recently recommended that employees working on its Gemini tools should work 60 hours a week and go into the office ""at least every weekday."" Wall Street has rewarded this rigor, as stock prices of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's parent, Alphabet, have surged since 2022. Startups also see a trickle-down effect from Big Tech companies' pressures. Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures, said he had noticed a ""pronounced shift"" toward leaner teams and rigorous performance standards at startups. Between performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, it's clear not only that the tech industry is done coddling employees, but that companies want to send the message those days are over. BI interviewed employees from tech giants, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, as well as various tech startups, about the changes. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity since they're not authorized to talk to the press, though their identities are known to BI. Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon did not comment.

Google,How to watch Mizzou Tigers basketball vs. Drake Bulldogs in the NCAA Tournament,"The Mizzou men's basketball team makes its first NCAA Tournament appearance in two years on Thursday when the No. 6-seeded Tigers face the No. 11-seeded Drake Bulldogs in Wichita, Kansas.

In Drake (30-3), which won the Missouri Valley Conference tournament at Enterprise Center in St. Louis, the Tigers must deal with the nation's slowest-paced team.

The Tigers (22-11) slipped to that sixth seed after a late-season slump, but they can make fans forget about that with a strong NCAA Tournament showing. Mizzou hasn't made it past the second round since 2008-09.

Mizzou and Drake have faced each other twice in the past 70 years, both Mizzou wins, one in Columbia and one in Des Moines, in the 1980s.

The winner of Thursday's game advances to a Saturday game vs. the winner of a game between No. 3 seed Texas Tech and No. 14 seed UNC Wilmington.

Google,What the Work of Literary Production Reveals About the Resonance of History,"The work: at first the work is difficult. Later, the work is also difficult. In between, I lose track of myself. Mostly because I am writing about the end of the world, or the end of a certain world, and because here I am, in the aftermath, writing in a quiet room, with a view of the forest, and the world is still going. People ask—my family, my therapist, my students—how is the work?

Article continues after advertisement

Because in the work, ghosts have appeared, the dead are moving between walls, a woman meets her double in the basement of a hotel in Montreal, a man waits in a train station every day for a year for his daughter to arrive back from the dead. In the work, a man buys two motorcycles—one for himself, and one for God. In the work, maybe, everyone I’m writing about is dead and not dead at the same time. It will take almost eight years to figure out the answer to this question. In my diary, I make notes about the work: what am I working on?

In my book, the dead are talking—they are calling across a room or a city, or they are just beyond the wall making a noise in their world loud enough so that we might be able to hear it in our world.

Also in the work: many Jews, all of the Jews, four very specific Jews. My family asks, in your work, are you writing about our family? Mostly, I deflect. My hearing is very bad, and I tell them I can’t hear the questions correctly. Or I say: talking about writing is boring. Or I say—the work is ongoing, its still ongoing, its distressing how ongoing it is. A year later, two years later, nine years later, the same people ask the same question about the work, but the answer is different. The work is everything, and the work is heartbreaking.

*

I recognize now, from a better distance, with better hearing, that I was also working from a place of obsession. First—the very end of Jewish Vienna, the music of Gustav Mahler; who was a Jew who had to stop being a Jew in order to make music; his Kindertotenlieder; or the short, smuggled burst of Klezmer in his First Symphony; or a recording of his Ninth Symphony made by the Vienna Philharmonic in January 1938 two months before the Anschluss, a recording in which Mahler’s former student Bruno Walter takes the final movement uncharacteristically fast, almost twice as fast; it is hard not to hear it and to think the players are in a hurry to get somewhere; at least nine of the musicians on stage that night were eventually murdered. Leonard Bernstein once compared this final movement, which is marked esterbend, or dying away, to the way a heart beats as it nears death, the way it loses rhythm and breaks apart.

Or I became consumed with the village where my family came from: first with its Yizkor book, its book of memory, a copy of which is held by the New York Public Library. I became consumed with the men in that book who all have my grandfather’s face. Or, a black and white image of the village’s river, a picture which, some mornings, I swear momentarily turns to color in front of me. At a certain point while I was working, Google drove its cars through the village’s streets, and I was able to do something I had no desire to do in my actual life, which was to walk around this place, this speck of green emerging from the deep past. From my desk, the village scared me even to see in pictures. Seeing it this way meant, however, that I could walk on its road, which was not really a road, or I could walk beside the old synagogue, which still existed, but only in pieces: every window was broken a hundred years ago and nothing had been repaired.

Before, all I knew of this place was the way it had died—thirty-eight years after my family left this place for America, every remaining Jew in the village was killed on a single night. Deaths squads marched the community to a nearby airfield and the Jews were shot one by one. In the pictures, from my desk, the village is a ruin, but is a green ruin. Obviously, the village has been photographed in summer. The trees are heavy. The river—my great-grandparent’s river—is still and blue. I’ve read that often the cars that Google hires to photograph places like this go in the early morning, when people are not yet awake. Maybe this is why the village is entirely empty, why there is no evidence of any human life. Although, in my memory, this is how it’s always been—everyone has always been gone.

*

By the time I found these pictures, I already knew the basics of the novel I was making, which was about the Alterman family, a family from Vienna who had both survived the war and who had not survived the war. The novel is split into four sections, one for each member of the family, and in each section of the novel, the member of the family narrating is the only person who has lived. Writing it this way meant that I was writing both their life and their death and also their afterlife, and the places, too, where these ideas sped up or slowed down or broke apart into pieces. A mother is alive, writing about the loss of her daughter; and then the daughter is alive, writing about the memory of her mother. This was my idea for the novel all along—that in creating a book that tempts the reader to believe in impossible things, that the horror of history might feel new to them when those impossible things do not arrive.

By then, I have understand something essential about the history—no matter how often we are told of the awful past…the hope remains that we have heard the story wrong.

In the middle of all of this—I move to the woods. In the woods, it’s easier to feel heartbreak and distress. Or at least, one can practice the art of distress and heartbreak without having to be so quiet. Also, I get my hearing fixed. For a very long time before this I had not been able to hear properly. A long time: most of my life. This part is maybe not interesting: in crowded spaces, in certain quiet spaces, when there was wind, when there was especially quiet music, beautiful music, I could not hear. When more than one of my family members were speaking I could not hear any of them. I could not hear while I was teaching, or while I was trying to listen to someone else teach. I had, until I was forty-three never understood anything ever whispered to me in confidence.

The doctor who ran my initial tests told me, when we fix this you’re going to hear birds now. A sentence I laughed at. Of course, I’d heard birds before. But he was right. Afterward, the world is too loud. Do they ever stop? I asked my wife about the birds one of the first mornings afterward. Meaning: are they always like this? Always going? Always calling for us?

In my book, the dead are talking—they are calling across a room or a city, or they are just beyond the wall making a noise in their world loud enough so that we might be able to hear it in our world. In the waiting room of my audiologist, I make the final notes about the book. The office where I make these notes is not far from where my great-grandfather is buried. Also, it’s not far from the classroom where I teach. Before this I had never noticed how often I talked about the work in terms of hearing, or listening. Even at the very end of the process, it is still difficult. When my family asks, when my students ask, when strangers ask, I have nothing new to say.

Although by then, I have memorized my way around the shtetl. I have memorized too, the way the last movement of my favorite pieces of music rush to escape death. By then, I have understand something essential about the history—no matter how often we are told of the awful past, its miseries, its catastrophes, its ruination, its madnesses and slaughtering, the hope remains that we have heard the story wrong, that some essential truth has gotten lost in the transmission; surely not the whole village, not everyone, not the entire city, not the babies, not the graveyards. Surely we’ve heard it wrong.

Alone in the small dark box, a voice tells me to press a button when I hear the noise. I ask what I think is a good question: what exactly am I listening for?

Leonard Bernstein once compared this final movement, which is marked esterbend, or dying away, to the way a heart beats as it nears death, the way it loses rhythm and breaks apart. Article continues after advertisement Or I became consumed with the village where my family came from: first with its Yizkor book, its book of memory, a copy of which is held by the New York Public Library. I became consumed with the men in that book who all have my grandfather’s face. Or, a black and white image of the village’s river, a picture which, some mornings, I swear momentarily turns to color in front of me. At a certain point while I was working, Google drove its cars through the village’s streets, and I was able to do something I had no desire to do in my actual life, which was to walk around this place, this speck of green emerging from the deep past. From my desk, the village scared me even to see in pictures. Seeing it this way meant, however, that I could walk on its road, which was not really a road, or I could walk beside the old synagogue, which still existed, but only in pieces: every window was broken a hundred years ago and nothing had been repaired. Before, all I knew of this place was the way it had died—thirty-eight years after my family left this place for America, every remaining Jew in the village was killed on a single night. Deaths squads marched the community to a nearby airfield and the Jews were shot one by one. In the pictures, from my desk, the village is a ruin, but is a green ruin. Obviously, the village has been photographed in summer. The trees are heavy. The river—my great-grandparent’s river—is still and blue. I’ve read that often the cars that Google hires to photograph places like this go in the early morning, when people are not yet awake. Maybe this is why the village is entirely empty, why there is no evidence of any human life. Although, in my memory, this is how it’s always been—everyone has always been gone. * By the time I found these pictures, I already knew the basics of the novel I was making, which was about the Alterman family, a family from Vienna who had both survived the war and who had not survived the war. The novel is split into four sections, one for each member of the family, and in each section of the novel, the member of the family narrating is the only person who has lived. Writing it this way meant that I was writing both their life and their death and also their afterlife, and the places, too, where these ideas sped up or slowed down or broke apart into pieces. A mother is alive, writing about the loss of her daughter; and then the daughter is alive, writing about the memory of her mother. This was my idea for the novel all along—that in creating a book that tempts the reader to believe in impossible things, that the horror of history might feel new to them when those impossible things do not arrive. By then, I have understand something essential about the history—no matter how often we are told of the awful past…the hope remains that we have heard the story wrong. In the middle of all of this—I move to the woods. In the woods, it’s easier to feel heartbreak and distress. Or at least, one can practice the art of distress and heartbreak without having to be so quiet. Also, I get my hearing fixed. For a very long time before this I had not been able to hear properly. A long time: most of my life. This part is maybe not interesting: in crowded spaces, in certain quiet spaces, when there was wind, when there was especially quiet music, beautiful music, I could not hear. When more than one of my family members were speaking I could not hear any of them. I could not hear while I was teaching, or while I was trying to listen to someone else teach. I had, until I was forty-three never understood anything ever whispered to me in confidence. Article continues after advertisement The doctor who ran my initial tests told me, when we fix this you’re going to hear birds now. A sentence I laughed at. Of course, I’d heard birds before. But he was right. Afterward, the world is too loud. Do they ever stop? I asked my wife about the birds one of the first mornings afterward. Meaning: are they always like this? Always going? Always calling for us? In my book, the dead are talking—they are calling across a room or a city, or they are just beyond the wall making a noise in their world loud enough so that we might be able to hear it in our world. In the waiting room of my audiologist, I make the final notes about the book. The office where I make these notes is not far from where my great-grandfather is buried. Also, it’s not far from the classroom where I teach. Before this I had never noticed how often I talked about the work in terms of hearing, or listening. Even at the very end of the process, it is still difficult. When my family asks, when my students ask, when strangers ask, I have nothing new to say. Although by then, I have memorized my way around the shtetl. I have memorized too, the way the last movement of my favorite pieces of music rush to escape death. By then, I have understand something essential about the history—no matter how often we are told of the awful past, its miseries, its catastrophes, its ruination, its madnesses and slaughtering, the hope remains that we have heard the story wrong, that some essential truth has gotten lost in the transmission; surely not the whole village, not everyone, not the entire city, not the babies, not the graveyards. Surely we’ve heard it wrong. Alone in the small dark box, a voice tells me to press a button when I hear the noise. I ask what I think is a good question: what exactly am I listening for? __________________________________ Article continues after advertisement Rooms for Vanishing by Stuart Nadler is available from Dutton, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House, LLC.","in the work, a man buys two motorcycles—one for himself, and one for God . it will take almost eight years to figure out the answer to this question .","buys motorcycles, motorcycles god, motorcycles"
Google,"Teenager Flees From Babysitting Nightmare, Sister Goes Ballistic Blasting Him On Social Media","ADVERTISEMENT

There’s free help, and then there’s free labor disguised as family bonding. Some relatives can’t tell the difference. One minute, you’re a teenager minding your business, and the next, you’ve been “promoted” to full-time babysitter, minus the paycheck, benefits or, you know, consent.

That’s exactly what happened to one Redditor who found himself trapped in a never-ending babysitting gig, courtesy of his older sis and some serious family entitlement. But when he decided to escape the madness, things took a turn so dramatic even reality TV producers would take notes.

The teen’s parents try to trick him into moving back, paying rent and being an unpaid babysitter, as they can’t afford childcare anymore, but he laughs in their faces

At just 17, our OP (original poster) was unknowingly signed up for an after-school job he never applied for: watching his sister’s two young kids. Every. Single. Day. No discussions, no contracts, no payment—just an unspoken rule that as soon as he walked through the door, he was on duty. His sister? She was already halfway out the door, living her best life.

ADVERTISEMENT

The breaking point came when the OP dared to have plans of his own. He let his sister know he wouldn’t be around to babysit, but she conveniently ignored him. When he got home, she was dolled up and ready to go, pushing past him, leaving anyway. The OP was fuming, as he missed his friend’s birthday party because his family didn’t care about his time. So, what’s a frustrated teen to do? Escape. And so he did.

The next day, the OP pulled off a flawless Houdini act. Instead of going home, he went straight to his friend’s house, ignoring the barrage of angry calls from his sister. The result? Grounded, scolded and labeled a traitor to “family first” values. But the OP wasn’t backing down. He found a job and moved in with his friend’s family. His parents lost their minds, threatening legal action against the kindhearted family that took him in.

Meanwhile, his sister decided to get creative and literally abandoned her kids on his friend’s doorstep, assuming he’d have no choice but to take them in. Unfortunately for her, the OP was at work, and the cops got involved. But did that stop her? Nope! Instead of, you know, hiring an actual babysitter, she resorted to harassing the OP online and even showing up at his friend’s house to offer the generous wage of… 10 dollars.

OP laughed in her face and shut the door. But then, his parents played the long con at his niece’s birthday party when they asked the OP to move back in. But not out of love or concern, but because they couldn’t afford childcare anymore. Oh, and he’d have to pay rent and watch the kids again. His response? Sweet, freeing laughter. He dropped off the gift and walked away from the trap they thought they had so cleverly set.

It’s one thing to occasionally help out with younger siblings, but when an older child is expected to step into a parental role, that’s called parentification. It’s a fancy way of saying, “Congrats, you’re now responsible for a child you didn’t create.” This happens when parents or, in this case, siblings, put their own responsibilities on a kid’s shoulders, usually with zero regard for how it affects them.

It’s exhausting, unfair, and can mess with a teen’s ability to enjoy their own youth. Parentification can impact a child’s emotional and psychological well-being, possibly contributing to anxiety and depression, and even creating trust issues. Because being forced into a caregiver role at a young age doesn’t build character—it builds resentment.

I get it, life is expensive, but that doesn’t give anyone the right to force their kids or siblings into giving up their lives to babysit for free. People who take advantage of others usually come wrapped in guilt-tripping tactics and sweet-talking manipulation. They’ll make you feel bad for saying no while conveniently ignoring all the times you’ve said yes.

If you constantly feel like you’re the only one putting in effort while they skate by with excuses, congratulations, you’re being taken advantage of. The pros suggest that when someone expects you to take care of their needs, asking for favors without returning them, it’s a clear sign that you are being used. The best way to handle it? Start saying no, loudly and often. They’ll either get the hint or get mad, but at least you’ll be free.

Moral of the story? If you need childcare, maybe start browsing actual babysitting services instead of hunting down your teenage sibling.

Google,Another sign of a dealmaking comeback? Adtech firm Adform is exploring a sale.,"Adform is exploring a sale, another sign of a rebound in the adtech M&A market.

Adform, founded in 2002, offers products for both advertisers and publishers.

Adform declined to comment.

The Nordic adtech company Adform is exploring a sale, four people familiar with its plans told Business Insider. A deal would mark the latest sign that the adtech M&A market is bouncing back after a couple of tepid years.

The four people said Adform had appointed Carnegie, a Swedish investment bank, to lead the process. They asked for anonymity to protect their business relationships; their identities are known to BI.

One of those people said Adform asked prospective buyers to submit their bids in April.

Adform and Carnegie declined to comment.

Founded in Denmark in 2002, Adform is one of the oldest independent adtech companies. Unlike many of its competitors, which tend to focus on either the advertiser side or publisher side of ad transactions, Adform offers solutions for both.

Those include a demand-side platform that helps advertisers buy and manage their ad campaigns across various media channels, data management platforms that help both advertisers and publishers organize their data, and ad servers where its clients can store their ads and track their campaigns.

Those assets could be attractive to other adtech companies, private equity firms, or the growing number of companies that have recently launched so-called retail media and commerce media businesses, such as supermarkets, e-commerce platforms, apps, and travel and leisure companies.

While it's been around a long time, Adform has struggled to gain the kind of traction in the market enjoyed by its US rivals, such as Google and The Trade Desk.

Adform reported revenue of 88.6 million euros, around $97 million, in 2023, down 3.7% from the prior year, according to its most recently published annual report. The company said the decline reflected economic uncertainty that led to advertisers reducing their marketing spend. ""EBITDA before special earnings,"" its measure of profitability, came in at 16.9 million euros, or around $18.5 million. The company said it employed around 669 employees on average throughout 2023.

Adform had once planned to go public with hopes of raising $100 million, but it shelved its initial public offering in 2018, blaming the volatility in the financial markets at the time. The company has long been the subject of potential takeover rumors.

The adtech M&A market appears to be revving back into action after a quiet couple of years marred by ad spend slowdowns, economic volatility, and uncertainty around the impact of privacy and policy changes from the likes of Apple and Google.

Notable deals so far this year have included:","Adform is exploring a sale, another sign of a rebound in the adtech M&A market.

JP Morgan,Elon Musk is MIA as a CEO. He's not alone.,"Tesla's stock has spent the past few months on autopilot , barreling toward a crash. Protesters angry with CEO Elon Musk's politics are burning electric-vehicle charging stations and vandalizing Cybertrucks , leading some owners to offload the cars before they become the next targets. A JPMorgan analyst said last week that the precipitous drop of some 50% of Tesla's market cap was unprecedented in the auto industry . And instead of returning to the dusty Tesla floor where he used to sleep to inspire workers to ""give it their all,"" Musk is continuing to play Donald Trump's all-powerful ""first buddy"" in Washington.

Musk's role at the White House DOGE office has made Tesla investors want their CEO back. But he's far from the first chief executive to go AWOL.

Absent leadership ""is something of a silent epidemic in corporations,"" says Laura McHale, the managing director of the professional coaching firm Conduit Consultants Limited. It can take several forms, she says: from ""leader distance,"" where CEOs are physically OOO as they court investors or go on the panel circuit or communicate infrequently, to psychological neglect (lacking direction, not delegating, failing to give employees proper recognition). While absenteeism is quieter than headline-making destructive behaviors like bullying or abuse, McHale says it's more common — and can be just as harmful to company morale and productivity. ""And yet, it's almost never talked about.""

The scope of the issue is hard to measure in part because what modern CEOs do all day — Musk included — is somewhat of a mystery. Until about 50 years ago, a chief executive's time was largely trackable, as they spent most of their day closely overseeing their company's product. But as mergers and IPOs became more common and corporations became more global, the CEO's role shifted from an internal product leader to a public figure seeking to drive shareholder value on the world stage. Today, many top CEOs jump from executive positions at companies in different industries rather than working their way up and learning a company inside and out. As they focus on building their personal brand or even working with an eye on the company's future, they may lose sight of the day-to-day operations that build strong company cultures. A 2009 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics found that as CEOs become superstars as well known as the companies they run, they begin to underperform. The ""consequences of media-induced superstar status for shareholders are negative,"" the study concluded.

Even at smaller firms, leaders' attention can become easily diverted. At startups in particular, CEOs have to focus on raising money and pleasing investors, which often takes them away from their offices. This absenteeism can turn ""toxic,"" McHale says. ""It is very destructive for employees and systems. It minimizes the importance of social relationships with our leaders."" A 2015 Interact/Harris Poll of US workers found that most of the communication issues people had with their company leaders weren't about bullying or demeaning behavior, but about what their bosses weren't doing: whether not knowing employees' names or not giving clear directions or recognizing their achievements. A paper from 2010 found that ""laissez-faire"" leadership was more prevalent than other types of destructive leadership. And a recently updated paper found that companies whose CEOs worked remotely were more likely to underperform and have lower valuations.

Musk is far from the first CEO to try to wear the hat in two places: Steve Jobs ran Apple and Pixar simultaneously, and Jack Dorsey oversaw Twitter (now X) and Square (now Block). But Jobs was a largely hands-off manager at Pixar, delegating tasks to other execs. Twitter had always been difficult to monetize and effectively moderate, and Dorsey stepped down in 2021.

But much as there's no comparison for Tesla's plunge in value, Musk himself is incomparable. In addition to Tesla and X, Musk has on his plate Neuralink, The Boring Company, SpaceX, and xAI. He remains chief executive of Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI — that's in addition to posting on X at a dizzying pace and fathering 14 children. In 2022, when he added Twitter to his empire of influential businesses, some management experts speculated that he'd bitten off more than he could chew. Musk slashed staff by 80% and ran the hobbled blue bird alongside his other companies for several months before naming Linda Yaccarino as CEO. A radically new version of Twitter, renamed X, still worked, defying many predictions that it would break under the pressure. Amid his X takeover, Tesla's stock also plummeted from a high of $309 a share in September 2022 to a low of $103 in January 2023 — because of concerns around EV demand, rising inflation and interest rates, and Musk's distractions at Twitter. But Tesla stock roared back through the rest of 2023.

So when Musk began raiding the federal government's IT system in the name of cost cutting, many were slow to count him out. Perhaps he could bring the outsider energy needed to pare down bureaucracy and keep his companies humming at the same time. So far, DOGE has fired thousands of workers, canceled lifesaving aid, and produced all-around chaos . You can debate how well Musk's tactics are working to cut government waste, but it's undeniable now that DOGE and Musk's political involvement are eating away at his biggest cash cow.

When it comes to Tesla, Musk is the missing CEO who isn't really missing — he's everywhere else. He dominates headlines each day, his face appearing constantly in the press and his posts gaining eyeballs all over X. That's part of Tesla's problem. Owners and would-be buyers of the cars no longer can separate Musk's political ideology from the brand, and his brutal cost-cutting tactics have turned people off. But it's not just Musk's divided attention and political unpopularity affecting the once premiere EV company: Tesla is facing several roadblocks , including increased competition in the electric vehicle industry from Chinese manufacturers and uncertainty around the development of its fully autonomous self-driving software.

Jumping in and out of the daily grind of companies ""is especially problematic when you're a micro-manager,"" says David Yoffie, a professor of international business administration at Harvard Business School. We know that Musk ""likes to really get into the weeds and into the details,"" Yoffie notes. But there aren't enough hours in a day to micromanage a handful of companies — and that makes it harder to dive deep into the core issues of each. In January and February, Musk was reportedly sleeping on the floor of his DOGE office across the street from the White House, adapting his hardcore playbook from working at Tesla and Twitter to show his dedication at DOGE. Musk traveled with Trump to Mar-a-Lago for a donor dinner as recently as this weekend. Following the election, he spent so much time at Trump's Florida oasis that the president joked: ""Elon won't go home. I can't get rid of him.""

Sometimes CEOs go long periods without seeing their employees or they communicate sporadically over email with staff in a way that creates more separation between themselves and workers. ""Without a finger on the pulse of what's really going on in their organization, they start losing credibility because they often will helicopter in, blow things up a little bit, create a big kerfuffle,"" Lori Dernavich, an executive coach and leadership development advisor, says of absent CEOs.

With Musk, the absenteeism isn't so silent. One Tesla backer, Christopher Tsai, has said he hopes Musk's "" involvement with DOGE is short-lived so he can spend even more time on his businesses."" Ross Gerber, a Tesla shareholder, told Business Insider in February that he was concerned about the other ventures that were pulling Musk's attention away from Tesla . ""His 100% focus is on AI, and that's really a detriment to Tesla more than it's a plus for xAI and all the other businesses because he doesn't work at Tesla anymore,"" Gerber said. ""If he were putting all of his time into Full Self-Driving, I'd feel a lot more confident about Tesla.""

Some founders start companies with an entrepreneurial spirit but find themselves bored with the day-to-day tasks of a CEO. That's generally a time for them to transition to a chairman role — perhaps the way Dorsey did with Twitter when he was pushed out of his role as CEO in 2008 — but not all willingly bow out. As a result, ""their sporadic presence means that they become a bottleneck for the organization,"" Dernavich says. ""That bottleneck leads to resentment, poor decision-making, slower response times, and the culture gets affected. So much can start going haywire when that happens.""

Asked how he's running his businesses alongside the demands of DOGE, Musk recently told Fox Business in a rare interview that he was doing so ""with great difficulty ."" It was a bad week. An outage took X offline (Musk later blamed a ""massive cyberattack"" originating in Ukraine, which experts have cast doubt on), and a second SpaceX rocket exploded during a launch. Tesla lost $127 billion in market cap in one day. Trump just bought a Tesla with hopes of boosting the car's popularity. He'll have to buy quite a few more to make up for Tesla's losses. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

Musk could afford for his wealth to drop by $100 billion or more in support of his political opinions, and his other companies are doing just fine. But being one of the most powerful people in the world means your actions and views have an outsize effect on everyone, including customers, shareholders, and workers at Tesla. Musk may have the stamina to hold out. The others may not.

Amanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry. She writes about the biggest tech companies and trends.","Tesla's stock has spent the past few months on autopilot , barreling toward a crash. Protesters angry with CEO Elon Musk's politics are burning electric-vehicle charging stations and vandalizing Cybertrucks , leading some owners to offload the cars before they become the next targets. A JPMorgan analyst said last week that the precipitous drop of some 50% of Tesla's market cap was unprecedented in the auto industry . And instead of returning to the dusty Tesla floor where he used to sleep to inspire workers to ""give it their all,"" Musk is continuing to play Donald Trump's all-powerful ""first buddy"" in Washington. Musk's role at the White House DOGE office has made Tesla investors want their CEO back. But he's far from the first chief executive to go AWOL. Absent leadership ""is something of a silent epidemic in corporations,"" says Laura McHale, the managing director of the professional coaching firm Conduit Consultants Limited. It can take several forms, she says: from ""leader distance,"" where CEOs are physically OOO as they court investors or go on the panel circuit or communicate infrequently, to psychological neglect (lacking direction, not delegating, failing to give employees proper recognition). While absenteeism is quieter than headline-making destructive behaviors like bullying or abuse, McHale says it's more common — and can be just as harmful to company morale and productivity. ""And yet, it's almost never talked about."" The scope of the issue is hard to measure in part because what modern CEOs do all day — Musk included — is somewhat of a mystery. Until about 50 years ago, a chief executive's time was largely trackable, as they spent most of their day closely overseeing their company's product. But as mergers and IPOs became more common and corporations became more global, the CEO's role shifted from an internal product leader to a public figure seeking to drive shareholder value on the world stage. Today, many top CEOs jump from executive positions at companies in different industries rather than working their way up and learning a company inside and out. As they focus on building their personal brand or even working with an eye on the company's future, they may lose sight of the day-to-day operations that build strong company cultures. A 2009 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics found that as CEOs become superstars as well known as the companies they run, they begin to underperform. The ""consequences of media-induced superstar status for shareholders are negative,"" the study concluded. Even at smaller firms, leaders' attention can become easily diverted. At startups in particular, CEOs have to focus on raising money and pleasing investors, which often takes them away from their offices. This absenteeism can turn ""toxic,"" McHale says. ""It is very destructive for employees and systems. It minimizes the importance of social relationships with our leaders."" A 2015 Interact/Harris Poll of US workers found that most of the communication issues people had with their company leaders weren't about bullying or demeaning behavior, but about what their bosses weren't doing: whether not knowing employees' names or not giving clear directions or recognizing their achievements. A paper from 2010 found that ""laissez-faire"" leadership was more prevalent than other types of destructive leadership. And a recently updated paper found that companies whose CEOs worked remotely were more likely to underperform and have lower valuations. Musk is far from the first CEO to try to wear the hat in two places: Steve Jobs ran Apple and Pixar simultaneously, and Jack Dorsey oversaw Twitter (now X) and Square (now Block). But Jobs was a largely hands-off manager at Pixar, delegating tasks to other execs. Twitter had always been difficult to monetize and effectively moderate, and Dorsey stepped down in 2021. But much as there's no comparison for Tesla's plunge in value, Musk himself is incomparable. In addition to Tesla and X, Musk has on his plate Neuralink, The Boring Company, SpaceX, and xAI. He remains chief executive of Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI — that's in addition to posting on X at a dizzying pace and fathering 14 children. In 2022, when he added Twitter to his empire of influential businesses, some management experts speculated that he'd bitten off more than he could chew. Musk slashed staff by 80% and ran the hobbled blue bird alongside his other companies for several months before naming Linda Yaccarino as CEO. A radically new version of Twitter, renamed X, still worked, defying many predictions that it would break under the pressure. Amid his X takeover, Tesla's stock also plummeted from a high of $309 a share in September 2022 to a low of $103 in January 2023 — because of concerns around EV demand, rising inflation and interest rates, and Musk's distractions at Twitter. But Tesla stock roared back through the rest of 2023. So when Musk began raiding the federal government's IT system in the name of cost cutting, many were slow to count him out. Perhaps he could bring the outsider energy needed to pare down bureaucracy and keep his companies humming at the same time. So far, DOGE has fired thousands of workers, canceled lifesaving aid, and produced all-around chaos . You can debate how well Musk's tactics are working to cut government waste, but it's undeniable now that DOGE and Musk's political involvement are eating away at his biggest cash cow. When it comes to Tesla, Musk is the missing CEO who isn't really missing — he's everywhere else. He dominates headlines each day, his face appearing constantly in the press and his posts gaining eyeballs all over X. That's part of Tesla's problem. Owners and would-be buyers of the cars no longer can separate Musk's political ideology from the brand, and his brutal cost-cutting tactics have turned people off. But it's not just Musk's divided attention and political unpopularity affecting the once premiere EV company: Tesla is facing several roadblocks , including increased competition in the electric vehicle industry from Chinese manufacturers and uncertainty around the development of its fully autonomous self-driving software. Jumping in and out of the daily grind of companies ""is especially problematic when you're a micro-manager,"" says David Yoffie, a professor of international business administration at Harvard Business School. We know that Musk ""likes to really get into the weeds and into the details,"" Yoffie notes. But there aren't enough hours in a day to micromanage a handful of companies — and that makes it harder to dive deep into the core issues of each. In January and February, Musk was reportedly sleeping on the floor of his DOGE office across the street from the White House, adapting his hardcore playbook from working at Tesla and Twitter to show his dedication at DOGE. Musk traveled with Trump to Mar-a-Lago for a donor dinner as recently as this weekend. Following the election, he spent so much time at Trump's Florida oasis that the president joked: ""Elon won't go home. I can't get rid of him."" Sometimes CEOs go long periods without seeing their employees or they communicate sporadically over email with staff in a way that creates more separation between themselves and workers. ""Without a finger on the pulse of what's really going on in their organization, they start losing credibility because they often will helicopter in, blow things up a little bit, create a big kerfuffle,"" Lori Dernavich, an executive coach and leadership development advisor, says of absent CEOs. With Musk, the absenteeism isn't so silent. One Tesla backer, Christopher Tsai, has said he hopes Musk's "" involvement with DOGE is short-lived so he can spend even more time on his businesses."" Ross Gerber, a Tesla shareholder, told Business Insider in February that he was concerned about the other ventures that were pulling Musk's attention away from Tesla . ""His 100% focus is on AI, and that's really a detriment to Tesla more than it's a plus for xAI and all the other businesses because he doesn't work at Tesla anymore,"" Gerber said. ""If he were putting all of his time into Full Self-Driving, I'd feel a lot more confident about Tesla."" Some founders start companies with an entrepreneurial spirit but find themselves bored with the day-to-day tasks of a CEO. That's generally a time for them to transition to a chairman role — perhaps the way Dorsey did with Twitter when he was pushed out of his role as CEO in 2008 — but not all willingly bow out. As a result, ""their sporadic presence means that they become a bottleneck for the organization,"" Dernavich says. ""That bottleneck leads to resentment, poor decision-making, slower response times, and the culture gets affected. So much can start going haywire when that happens.""

JP Morgan,Donald Trump and Elon Musk won’t be able to go on ignoring the damage to the bottom line,"Can it last?

This is the question many sensible people are asking about the position of Elon Musk in the Trump administration.

Sceptics might well point out that Musk has lasted longer than many appointees did in Trump’s clownish first administration. But none of them had the strange hybrid status of Musk – with one foot in the White House and the other in corporate American enterprises such as SpaceX and Tesla.

It is good to remind ourselves of some aspects of Musk. He recently suggested that the result of the last UK general election should be reversed by the simple expedient of King Charles III removing Keir Starmer from office.

He intervened in German politics by urging German voters to support the anti-EU Alternativ Für Deutschland party (AFD). One can only guess what interventions he will be tempted to make in other future EU member state elections.

The only serious metric of overall political success and effectiveness in the mind of Donald Trump (if I can use that term meaningfully) is the state of the US stock market – a market that increasingly resembles an overheated Ponzi scheme where vast quantities of paper wealth seek roosting ledges like seabirds on vertiginous economic cliffs.

There is, for some, a delicious irony in the huge financial gains made in the last week by US hedge funds short-selling Tesla shares. The Financial Times reports this week that they have made $16.2 billion on foot of the collapse of the Tesla share price which had risen from less than $200 to peak at more than $450 in the aftermath of the November election. Previous short sellers of Tesla shares had lost more than $64 billion in 2024 as investors piled on to the Tesla bandwagon.

Vagaries of hedge fund speculations excite little sympathy or enthusiasm from most people – especially those who watched the Big Short movie. But the damage that Musk is doing to his Tesla enterprise has hit home. It even provoked Donald Trump to pretend that he was personally buying a Tesla in a much-publicised tyre-kicking stunt at a newly designated White House portico sales forecourt.

Trump, who campaigned by frequently deriding electric vehicles (EVs) and their owners, is now trying against the odds to sell Teslas to the loyal fan-base which enthusiastically cheered his “Drill, Drill, Drill” call for the expansion of hydrocarbon-driven vehicles. In fairness, Trump may not be licensed to drive but he has pioneering experience in the use of battery-powered vehicles – on the golf course.

Sales of Teslas outside the US – especially in Europe and Canada – have plummeted as Musk’s reputation has tarnished their gloss. Investors in Tesla stock have lost huge sums in the paper value of their portfolios. Some are even calling for Musk to quit politics. If he is minded to exit, he will quite likely do so suddenly and will explain his departure by claiming that he has accomplished his DOGE goals and that his chainsaw role is complete.

Of course, he still has his interests in SpaceX and Starlink – as he has pointed out to would-be boycotters in Canada. But a halving of his Tesla share price and reports that JP Morgan predicts an end-of-year value of as low as $120 for its shares currently trading at more than $230 is a poor lookout.

Musk is reported to be focusing on the Indian market, but he will face serious competition there from Chinese and other Asian EV producers.

Musk labelled previous unsuccessful short sellers as “insane” and insists that the company will recover as pioneers in autonomous vehicle technology. But it is hard to see US investors share his optimism or him cornering and retaining the market in autonomous vehicle revolution, if and when that occurs.

The resumed Israeli destruction of Gaza, agreed in advance with the Trump administration, and the newly restarted US bombing campaign against the Houthis may appear as Trump flexing military muscle. Neither event, by itself, will affect the Dow Jones or Nasdaq indices. It seems safe in terms of exposing American lives or share prices by military intervention. From the safety of an American cockpit, innocent Arab lives just don’t matter. Extending air war to Iran may be tempting as a risk-free option as well.

But Trump’s other front – the tariff wars – is not politically or economically risk-free. Recession, even temporary, may spook the stock markets. Tariffs on steel and aluminium will raise production costs in the US from Boeings to beer cans – and lots more inflation in between.

Trump’s much-vaunted “art of the deal” skill now seems totally absent in US dealings with Putin over Ukraine. Making concessions as a precondition for negotiation is poor strategy. In the end, his deal-making skills proved utterly illusory in the case of North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Easier and less risky, then, to kill defenceless Arab children.","Can it last?

JP Morgan,"Tata Steel, JSW Steel, SAIL, Jindal Steel, NMDC shares gain as DGTR recommends safeguard duty","Steel stocks surged on Wednesday after the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) recommended a provisional safeguard duty of 12 per cent on steel imports. The duty on flat steel products will be levied for 200 days, pending final investigation.

Following a complaint from the Indian Steel Association, the DGTR commenced an investigation into the sudden surge in imports of non-alloy and alloy steel flat products in December 2024.

Reacting to the latest development, metal stocks drove the sectoral index by 1.27 per cent to end at 9,148.55. Shares of SAIL, Hindustan Zinc, NMDC, Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Jindal Stainless Steel emerged among the top Nifty metal gainers.

Tata Steel shares soared 2.51 per cent to end at ₹158.54 on the NSE, leading the pack of Nifty 50 components. SAIL shares settled 3.98 per cent higher at ₹113.15 after hitting an intraday high of ₹114.40.

NMDC gained 3.47 per cent to end at ₹69.09 and JSW Steel rose 1.27 per cent to ₹1,031.

Bullish brokerages

Brokerages cheer the long-awaited safeguard duty is positive on the sector as it may provide short-term price support. This is welcome step to restrict trade flows amidst uncertainty caused by US tariffs, according to Tushar Chaudhari, Research Analyst of PL Capital.

“The domestic steel prices had moved in anticipation of the safeguard duty over last few weeks which has resulted in the gap between the landed prices and domestic prices increasing,” said Parthiv Jhonsa, Lead Analyst - Metals & Mining, Anand Rathi Institutional Equities.

“This was the need for the hour, the industry players had been requesting the government for implementation of the safeguard duty for a few months now,” Jhonsa added.

Analysts of Kotak Institutional Equities emphasised that the domestic flat steel prices increased 5 per cent last month against the weakness in regional prices. “The divergent move is led by the widely anticipated safeguard duty, which could come in at 12-15 per cent, against a demand of 25 per cent. Domestic prices are at a 7-8 per cent premium to import parity, leaving little room for further hikes in the former case,” Kotak analysts added.

“As the positive impact from the expected price hike and lower coking coal cost is not immediate, the earnings are expected to improve in next one to two quarters. Over medium term, we expect the prices for flat steel to improve, which is expected to benefit flat steel manufacturers,” Jhonsa said.

Ravi Sodah, Equity Analyst, Elara Capital, expects a part of the price hike to be rolled back in the long run, due to a likely increase in domestic supply.

While brokerages flagged that margins have bottomed in the third quarter of FY25 and the potential supply reforms in China pose upside risks, the global brokerage JP Morgan is positively anticipating favourable reactions amid China output cuts.

JP Morgan said the latest 12 per cent duty is positive for the Indian steel sector, which when implemented could rise import costs by ₹5,500 per tonne. But, the domestic hot rolled coil (HRC) prices may increase only ₹2,000 per tonne depending on demand and restocking.

Tata Steel and JSW Steel are its preferred picks, but it also expects SAIL to also witness a sharp positive reaction.

Kotak prefers non-integrated players Jindal Steel & Power and JSW Steel. It has assigned sell calls on SAIL, Tata Steel and NMDC.

Emkay Global’s favoured exposures are Tata Steel and JSW Steel. The brokerage has assigned a buy on Tata Steel at a target price of ₹185. The brokerage has add calls on JSW Steel and SAIL at target prices of ₹1,100 and ₹120, respectively. Meanwhile, it has a reduce rating on Jindal Steel & Power at ₹825.

Axis Securities has upgraded rating on SAIL from hold to buy at an increased target price of ₹130.

Another global brokerage CLSA has increased the target prices on JSW Steel and Tata Steel to ₹825 and ₹145, respectively, assuming 12 per cent safeguard duty impact on fair value higher by over 7-10 per cent.

However, CLSA is relatively more constructive on non-ferrous metals and prefers Hindalco and Vedanta.

PL Capital remained positive on Jindal Steel, JSW Steel, Tata Steel and SAIL as they set floors to falling prices and emphasised that the pricing will now depend on domestic demand-supply situation.

Mining taxes & capacity addition

State taxes on mining are also a concern for miners. Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu have recently increased mining taxes. Analysts believe other States would follow and emphasise downside risk to mining margins for NMDC, SAIL and Tata Steel.

Karnataka has also proposed sharp increase in taxes for iron ore.

Kotak expects seaborne iron ore prices to remain subdued over CY2025-27 due to rising protectionism against Chinese steel exports, which would reduce steel production and iron ore imports.

Quoting CRISI’s data that the country’s flat steel consumption stood at 57 million tonne in FY24, Elara says that the upcoming capacity addition suggests a potential oversupply scenario, which could exert downward pressure on prices in the medium to long term.","Steel stocks surged on Wednesday after the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) recommended a provisional safeguard duty of 12 per cent on steel imports.

Over medium term, we expect the prices for flat steel to improve, which is expected to benefit flat steel manufacturers,” Jhonsa said. Ravi Sodah, Equity Analyst, Elara Capital, expects a part of the price hike to be rolled back in the long run, due to a likely increase in domestic supply. While brokerages flagged that margins have bottomed in the third quarter of FY25 and the potential supply reforms in China pose upside risks, the global brokerage JP Morgan is positively anticipating favourable reactions amid China output cuts. JP Morgan said the latest 12 per cent duty is positive for the Indian steel sector, which when implemented could rise import costs by ₹5,500 per tonne. But, the domestic hot rolled coil (HRC) prices may increase only ₹2,000 per tonne depending on demand and restocking. Tata Steel and JSW Steel are its preferred picks, but it also expects SAIL to also witness a sharp positive reaction. Kotak prefers non-integrated players Jindal Steel & Power and JSW Steel. It has assigned sell calls on SAIL, Tata Steel and NMDC. Emkay Global’s favoured exposures are Tata Steel and JSW Steel. The brokerage has assigned a buy on Tata Steel at a target price of ₹185. The brokerage has add calls on JSW Steel and SAIL at target prices of ₹1,100 and ₹120, respectively. Meanwhile, it has a reduce rating on Jindal Steel & Power at ₹825. Axis Securities has upgraded rating on SAIL from hold to buy at an increased target price of ₹130. Another global brokerage CLSA has increased the target prices on JSW Steel and Tata Steel to ₹825 and ₹145, respectively, assuming 12 per cent safeguard duty impact on fair value higher by over 7-10 per cent. However, CLSA is relatively more constructive on non-ferrous metals and prefers Hindalco and Vedanta. PL Capital remained positive on Jindal Steel, JSW Steel, Tata Steel and SAIL as they set floors to falling prices and emphasised that the pricing will now depend on domestic demand-supply situation. Mining taxes & capacity addition State taxes on mining are also a concern for miners. Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu have recently increased mining taxes. Analysts believe other States would follow and emphasise downside risk to mining margins for NMDC, SAIL and Tata Steel. Karnataka has also proposed sharp increase in taxes for iron ore. Kotak expects seaborne iron ore prices to remain subdued over CY2025-27 due to rising protectionism against Chinese steel exports, which would reduce steel production and iron ore imports. Quoting CRISI’s data that the country’s flat steel consumption stood at 57 million tonne in FY24, Elara says that the upcoming capacity addition suggests a potential oversupply scenario, which could exert downward pressure on prices in the medium to long term.","the duty on flat steel products will be levied for 200 days, pending final investigation .

JP Morgan,'Industry exorcising Musk'...,"Musk is killing Tesla. His lack of integrity, lack of internal consistency, and deeply fascistic leanings are now on full display for the world to see. And the world has responded by violently throwing up in their mouths. Tesla sales in the EU are down 45%, despite the EV market growing 37%. Tesla’s share price has plummeted by 41%, wiping hundreds of billions of dollars from its value. There are no signs that this will end, and JP Morgan is predicting that Tesla’s shares will lose 66% of their value by the end of the year. In fact, Tesla is selling so few vehicles that they are risking their lucrative regulatory emissions credit business, responsible for 30% of their total income! But if Musk is killing Tesla, Polestar wants to deliver the final blow. They are offering Tesla drivers a $20,000 discount for a new Polestar if they trade in their “swasticars.”

Yep, Polestar is offering anyone who owns or leases a Tesla $5,000 off a lease on a brand new Polestar 3. Combined with their latest $15,000 Polestar Clean Vehicle Incentive, any Tesla driver can buy a Polestar 3 for a whopping $20,000 off.

So, is that a good deal?

Well, take the Long Range Dual Motor variation of the Polestar 3. This gorgeous EV has a massive 111 kWh battery that gives it a WLTP range of 392 miles and can charge from 10% to 80% in only 32 minutes. It’s also no slouch, able to zip from 0 to 62 mph in just 5 seconds, and reviewers have highlighted that it handles and rides far better than anything Tesla has produced. On top of all of that, it’s super practical, with over 500 litres of cargo space and a massive 2,200 kg (4,850 lbs) towing capacity. Normally, this car retails for $79,400 and is pitched to compete against the new electric Porsche Macan and the Audi A6 Avant e-Tron Performance. In other words, it’s pretty damn premium. But, with Polestar’s incentives, it costs just $59,400 (when leased and a Tesla is traded in).

That is a few hundred dollars less than the brand-new Model Y with the terrible Cybertruck-esque facelift. It only has a 78.1 kWh battery, giving it a 353-mile WLTP range. It can charge from 10% to 80% slightly faster in just 27 minutes, but the range added in that time is less than the Polestar 3. It is somewhat faster with a 4.8-second 0–62 mph, but it reportedly handles much worse, and its ride is more choppy, so in the real world, it won’t be faster. It has slightly more cargo space than the Polestar but a smaller towing capacity of 1,600 kg (3,527 lbs).

So, they seem like close competitors, right? Well, no. The interior, technology, and reliability of the Polestar are in an entirely different league. It is a premium car, and the Tesla now feels more budget than modern budget cars. Not to mention that Tesla has a palpable brand association with Nazis, meaning that even if the EV specs were identical, the Polestar would still utterly dump on the Tesla. For the Model Y to compete with the Polestar 3, it has to dramatically cut its price, which will make Tesla’s sales, cash flow, and stock price issues so much worse.

So, if Musk has taken Tesla out the back to shoot it in the head, Polestar is pulling the trigger.

And it isn’t just Polestar doing this. Take Jaguar’s reinvention; it seemed a little silly at the time, but doesn’t it look attractive now? Buying a new electric Jaguar (when they come out) will be a perfect middle finger to the DEI-destroying Musk. Or what about Hyundai/Kia, BYD, MG, Renault, BMW, VW/Audi/Škoda, Rivian, XPeng, and others who are all slashing prices and launching new, high-quality EVs with better specs than Tesla?

The industry has seen where Tesla is going and is moving to cut its head off. And good — it’s time for Tesla to die. It was once a beacon of hope, but now it is a broken poison chalice.

JP Morgan,"Harris meeting JP Morgan, BNY and Goldman Sachs in New York today to get 'lay of the land'","BIG BUSINESSES SUCH as JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, BNY and Bank of Ireland have met with Tánaiste Simon Harris today as he rounds off his final day in the US.

The big message on Harris’ St Patrick’s Day trip has been around trade, with the Tánaiste stating that he wants to be honest with the public that things are likely to be “tumultuous” before an agreement, if any, is made between the EU and US on tariffs.

In New York today, back-to-back meetings were held with major industry players, with the Tánaiste telling The Journal that he hoped to gain “insights” from the companies that he can take back home.

Tomorrow, the Tánaiste will bring a memo to Cabinet updating his ministerial colleagues about what business and trade policy information he has gleaned from the US trip.

The message repeated, at nauseum at times this week, is that it is a two-way relationship that exists economically between the EU, Ireland and the United States.

There is hope that this message will sink in with big US business here, businesses that are very important players in the Irish economy when it comes to jobs.

Speaking ahead of his meetings with the big financiers, Harris said he wants to “get their insights to where they see the lay of the land”.

Harris nodded to the fact that under the Donald Trump administration, things can change rapidly, on a daily, and sometimes on an hourly basis.

Any insights he gets in New York will be brought back to the government’s new trade forum which meets on Friday. Harris will chair the group which is made up of departments, agencies and business groups.

He said the meeting will be a chance to “really take stock of where we’re at”.

“But I’ve got to be very honest with the Irish people. My view remains the same and remains consistent. I believe we are entering a turbulent period of time.

“As I keep on saying, and Europe keeps on saying, and all my counterparts keep on saying, every disagreement ends with agreement. There needs to be an intense engagement to find a way forward here, because trade is good for Ireland, good for Europe, and it’s good for the United States of America,” he said.

“As of today, my sense is that we’re likely to see the turbulence before the agreement. I think that would be regrettable. I think it’d be much better use of everybody’s time and energy to intensively engage,” he added.

The European Union, which has responsibilities and trade policy, stands ready to intensively engage with the US, he added.

In a bid to spread his message on trade, Harris also spoke to media interviews with Bloomberg and CNN on the issues.

He said talks should take place before the April deadline which has been mooted, stating that that there is time before then for talks and engagement to take place.

Businesses unhappy with pace of engagement

However, The Journal understands that business groups are deeply unhappy with the narrative circulating that things are likely to get worse before they get better, stating that pressure is likely to be put on government at Friday’s meeting to push the EU into talks and to consider re-opening the US tariff list agreed some years ago.

But what does turbulent times mean for the everyday Joe? What about threats to jobs?

The chairman of the IDA Chairman Fergal O’Rourke told the Irish Independent this week that he doesn’t foresee any immediate job losses.

When asked if he is jittery about possible job losses in the trade-war fallout, Harris said American companies know that to get access to the European Union, which is a massive market, they need to have a base in Europe.

“And Ireland offers a very good home to so many companies, companies that have done very well and that have made a lot of profit and absolutely have created a lot of jobs. So we don’t ever take investment for granted. We continue to work with companies, engage with companies,” he said.

Harris said the government will “control” what’s within their control, by investing in Ireland’s infrastructure and competitiveness.

“I think Ireland approaches this period of turbulence from a position of relevant strength,” said the Tánaiste.

Aside from big business concerns and jobs, any imposition of trade tariffs will increase costs for the consumer on both sides of the Atlantic.

No cost-of-living packages despite rising price threats

The government has ruled out a return to a further cost-of-living package, with Public Expenditure Minister Jack Chambers confirming in recent weeks that there will be no more energy credits bestowed on customers, despite warnings that energy costs are set to rise again this year.

Asked about whether a looming trade war might make the government reconsider such a plan, Harris said this government and the last government have a strong track record in terms of putting support packages in place. However, he added:

“We do have to be honest with people now that we do need to try and move to a more regular budgetary cycle. Inflation is falling, but that is not to say that we won’t be trying to assist people in the budget with the cost-of-living, but how we do it has be part of the regular budgetary cycle,” said Harris.

“We are going to get through this, our economy is in good stead. We have been setting billions [of Euros] into future funds and we used to get asked ‘why are doing that, why don’t you spend all the money now’. This is one of the reasons. You prepare a buffer for your economy from any shocks,” the Tánaiste said.","BIG BUSINESSES SUCH as JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, BNY and Bank of Ireland have met with Tánaiste Simon Harris today as he rounds off his final day in the US.

JP Morgan,The end of the genetic paradigm of cancer,"Abstract Genome sequencing of cancer and normal tissues, alongside single-cell transcriptomics, continues to produce findings that challenge the idea that cancer is a ‘genetic disease’, as posited by the somatic mutation theory (SMT). In this prevailing paradigm, tumorigenesis is caused by cancer-driving somatic mutations and clonal expansion. However, results from tumor sequencing, motivated by the genetic paradigm itself, create apparent ‘paradoxes’ that are not conducive to a pure SMT. But beyond genetic causation, the new results lend credence to old ideas from organismal biology. To resolve inconsistencies between the genetic paradigm of cancer and biological reality, we must complement deep sequencing with deep thinking: embrace formal theory and historicity of biological entities, and (re)consider non-genetic plasticity of cells and tissues. In this Essay, we discuss the concepts of cell state dynamics and tissue fields that emerge from the collective action of genes and of cells in their morphogenetic context, respectively, and how they help explain inconsistencies in the data in the context of SMT.

Introduction It is said that the wise only believe in what they can see, and the fools only see what they can believe in. The latter attitude cements paradigms, and paradigms are amplified by any new-looking glass that puts one’s way of seeing the world on steroids. In cancer research, such a self-fulfilling prophecy has been fueled by next-generation DNA sequencing. The ease of access to sequencing has stimulated the unfettered quest for genetic alterations in tumor cells that would explain cancer. Since the 1970s, the elevation of the concept of ‘cancer as a genetic disease’ [1–4] has been driven by a number of factors, including discoveries of cancer-associated mutations, narrowly gene-engineered mouse models, funding policies that follow crowd thinking, and the promise of targeted therapy. The propensity of the human mind to cling to simple, mechanistically plausible explanations further promoted narratives of oncogenic ‘driver mutations’ [5–7]. The somatic mutation theory (SMT) and its tacit claim to represent the “truth” on the origin of cancer is concisely articulated in this quotation by M. Stratton and L. Alexandrov from a decade ago: “All cancers originate from a single cell that starts to behave abnormally due to the acquired somatic mutations in its genome” (2014). [8] This quotation dates back to 2014—and we will present an updated 2024 version later. However, during the past decade, widespread acceptance of the SMT has driven the use of next-generation sequencing. With lowering costs of genome analysis, the genetic paradigm led to ‘precision oncology’; but targeting driver mutations has invariably met the challenge of relapse of treatment-resistant cancer, too fast and in far more aggressive form [9–13] than can be explained by selection for new mutants. Knowing the mutational profile of a patient’s tumor genome has yielded little benefit in ‘personalized/precision’ cancer care [7,9,14,15]. Ironically, over the past years, the same sequencing technology has exposed new cracks in the edifice of the cancer genetics paradigm. Table 1 summarizes the most salient findings that challenge the paradigm. Some sequencing results are compatible with the postulate of oncogenic mutations, but many inconvenient findings are overlooked for lack of critical discourse, resulting in an unbalanced view. Thus, an open discussion of the growing sequencing data that are contradictory to the genetic paradigm is due. The (apparent) paradox goes both ways: many cancers harbor no consistent driver mutations, while canonical oncogenic mutations are found in tissues that remain free of cancer [16] (see Table 1 for references). Paradoxes, according to Nils Bohr, are of course central for progress [17]—if properly recognized. PPT PowerPoint slide

TIFF original image Download: Table 1. ‘Paradoxical’ findings regarding the genetic paradigm of cancer uncovered by sequencing technology. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003052.t001 Large-scale cancer genome sequencing endeavors, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [82], launched in 2006 by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, have uncovered a mesmerizing breadth of genetic mutations associated with cancer. The vast, nearly chaotic diversity of genetic alterations found within the same nominal tumor type between patients is staggering and questions a deterministic logic of causation of cancer by mutations in oncogenic pathways (Table 1). However, patterns, such as recurrent mutational signatures and chromosomal rearrangements, are characteristic for distinct tumor types and stages [53,83] and point to a complex interplay between stochastic elements and some rule-governed biological causation. The immense diversity of functions of the (mutated) molecular pathways allegedly linked to cancer causation [21], and the fact that cancer is a robust, universal phenomenon amongst metazoans, tells a story of principles of development and evolution of multi-cellular life behind the very existence and the near- inevitability of neoplasia, transcending phylogenesis, ontogenesis and oncogenesis [84–94]. However, in the quest for predictive biomarkers and molecular targets, the cancer research community has abandoned deep thinking for deep sequencing, interpreting data through the lens of clinical translation detached from fundamental biology.

The core of the genetic paradigm: Somatic Darwinian evolution To revisit the role of mutations in carcinogenesis, we need to recall a central corollary of the cancer genetics paradigm that links somatic mutations to the cancer phenotype and cancer progression: namely, the idea of somatic Darwinian evolution of the mutated cells. Herein, random mutations may (by chance) confer functional advantages, e.g., promote autonomous proliferation that increase cell “fitness” [95]. Then, under natural selection in the cell population, those cells carrying mutations that confer a “fitter” phenotype would clonally expand, with the “fittest” clone (derived from a single cell) eventually taking over the population. This Neo-Darwinian scheme is applied to tumors in a loose, qualitative, if not figurative manner [96], often departing from rigorous concepts of evolutionary biology, and eventually becoming known as the SMT [97]. The idea of SMT has its origin in 1914 when the embryologist Theodor Boveri proposed that cancer originates from chromatin alterations in a cell. It was later recast in terms of accumulation of a number of genetic mutations by Bauer and Nordling in the 1950s [98, 99], implying a need for increased cellular proliferation that is acquired as a novel trait—but still without invoking Darwinian positive selection. The concept of carcinogenesis as an explicit process of (somatic) evolution in the Neo-Darwinian sense was popularized by Nowell’s seminal paper in 1976 [2]. However, he introduced a pluralistic view: “…this correlation between observable genetic change and tumor progression does not, of course, prove causality, and some workers believe that at least some aspects of the evolutionary process, (…) may represent epigenetic, rather than genetic phenomena.” These cautionary words have been largely left out of the equation of cancer genetics in the following 50 years. Despite its rapid ascendance, SMT remains a conjecture supported by spotty, selective evidence rather than a precisely formulated theory, notwithstanding its use of mathematical formalisms [100]. Specifically, SMT left out broader considerations of historicity (ontogenesis and phylogenesis) and physiology. First, autonomous proliferation appears to be a latent ‘default’ state, ‘baked-in’ in organismal existence already in the last universal common ancestor, and is not an evolutionary novelty that is attained through natural selection in the tissue [101,102]. Second, expansion of faster proliferating cell clones is not limited to tumors, as evident in aging normal tissue and chronic diseases where hyperproliferation results in oligo-clonal expansion [103–105]. Yet, convenient for its simplicity, but misleading in its meaning, the Neo-Darwinian principle has become the unquestioned truth in tumor biology which, as Table 1 shows, is responsible for many of the cracks in the genetic paradigm of cancer. Robust manifestation of natural selection in tumors would be ‘hard selective sweeps’ [106,107]: the complete overtaking of the tumor cell population by a malignant clone carrying the driver mutation (along with linked, but neutral mutations), representing one step in Vogelstein’s multi-step progression model of linear evolution [4,46]. The genetic fixation (as it is called in population genetics, see Table 1, point 6) of the oncogenic allele in the tumor cell population would be required for the logics of precision oncology that seeks to target a mutation to eradicate a tumor. In reality, a tumor contains thousands of genetically distinct, apparently independent cell clones, giving rise to genetic intra-tumor heterogeneity that came as a shock to the precision oncology world [37,42]. This finding led to attempts of adjusting precision oncology by targeting “trunk mutations” shared by every cancer cell and by combination therapy directed against multiple oncogenic mutations—approaches that still adhere to SMT [108]. But, even if a clone appears to expand faster and dominate the tumor, there is little proof that a complex tumor phenotype is sculpted by natural selection for specific oncogenic mutations that produce said ‘adaptive traits’ as Neo-Darwinism postulates. It is likely correct that simple Darwinian evolution is at display in the case of evasion from targeted therapy, notably kinase inhibitor drugs [41], wherein a point mutation in the kinase protein interferes with multiple aspects of kinase activity energetics, as best studied in the oncoprotein CBR-Abl, as it becomes resistant to the highly selective inhibitor imatinib [109]. But, adaptive selection of such molecular phenotype is a far cry from the suggested generation of complex traits that embody the “hallmarks of cancer”[110,111] by natural selection during tumor progression. Thus, SMT suffers from the same shortcoming as Neo-Darwinian evolution [112] in that it only explains distinct localized adaptive traits obviously linked to the selection pressure but not the emergence of complex, higher-order biological functions. One must also not forget that neutral variants can be enriched without being selected for (Table 1, points 5, 6) because of (random) genetic drift in relatively small cell populations. In finite cell populations the mathematics of random birth-death processes alone accounts for highly skewed allele frequency distributions that defy our numerical intuition (“the rich get richer—without being more capable”) [39,113,114], although neutral drift may be overestimated because of late appearing subclonal driver mutations [115]. Complicating the picture of somatic evolution are interactions at a higher level, like those between subclones of cancer cells that affect fitness of the entire tumor [116–119], creating non-cell autonomous dynamics [104]. Beyond direct mutual stimulation, the distinct clones may functionally complement each other because of their ‘specialist’ capabilities that support the cancer cell community, for instance, through metabolism that alters pH and nutrients in the intercellular space, detoxification, promotion of angiogenesis, alteration of tissue mechanics [105], or averting anti-tumor immunity. These biological functions are not sufficient to grow a tumor themselves. Conversely, some tumor cells may keep their more malignant neighbors at bay and must not be killed [106]. Thus, if we view the tumor as an evolving ecosystem, as has become fashionable, we also must embrace evolutionary/ecological principles that have emerged in the past few decades and that question the dominance of the simple scheme of ‘natural selection’ of Neo-Darwinism [55,120–124]. These include punctuated equilibrium (stasis with sudden bursts of evolutionary events) [125,126], group selection (for fitness of a group due to social behaviors) [126,127], niche construction (evolving organism modifies its own selective environment) [128] and structuralism (natural selection must obey constraints of physics, chemistry and geometry, etc. which contribute to shaping the phenotype with no selection) [129]. Of particular relevance is the group of evolutionary theories that emphasize phenotypic plasticity [123,130,131]. These theories all suggest that the direction of evolutionary adaptation of populations ‘tracks’ the physiological adaptation of the individual to its environment as enabled by regulated phenotype plasticity, such as acclimatization. These theories include genetic assimilation/genomic accommodation [123,130–132], the Baldwin effect and canalization [133,134], and phenotype-first dynamics [94,135]. These mutation-less mechanisms may ‘lubricate’ and channel natural selection; thus, they actually support Darwinian natural selection by making evolution of adaptive traits more likely in view of the ‘unlikely’ mutations that need to happen. Thus, despite being largely absent in SMT literature, all these theories indirectly support Darwinism by considering non-genetic plasticity, thereby relaxing the rigid one-genotype-one-phenotype constraint.

Overcoming the limitations of the current paradigm: Expand it or replace it? Calls for overcoming the blinders of the genetic paradigm have a long history. What is new is that, first, the same omics technologies employed to identify new oncogenic mutations have also been used to better understand non-genetic processes in tumorigenesis that involve cell plasticity and tissue organization. And second, the quest for drug targets or biomarkers have meanwhile reduced much of cancer research from a scholarly biological discipline to a transactional operation concerned more with cataloguing molecular alterations and finding associations, than with understanding fundamental principles using formal theory [136]. The zest for intellectual discourse on the nature of cancer, the type of scholarly discourse that advances all scientific disciplines, is long gone, or viewed upon with suspicion. Since one should not postulate the end of a paradigm without specifying the ‘alternatives’ that may correct or replace it, we will discuss here two sets of ideas that have been sidelined by the dominance of the genetic paradigm of cancer. First, that “cancer is not a disease of the genes”, but of gene regulation and thus, of the cell. We must consider the dynamics of the collective action of genes in a network that governs cell behaviors. Second, that ‘cancer is not a disease of the cell’, but of tissues [137]; we must consider principles of tissue organization. Both of these ‘alternatives’ are discussed in detail below. To interpret observations afforded by powerful new technologies, we more than ever need a solid framework grounded in biological principles that must be rigorously formulated (but may not yet be mathematically formalized) [138]. Cancer research needs to return from current transactional activities to the scholarly investigations enjoyed by generations of biologists who have placed new findings in the context of organisms, their development, physiology and evolution [136,139]. As Philip Ball points out, the apparent lack of ‘progress’ in the biological sciences may be related to the adoption of a mistaken paradigm [140]. Herein, we will illuminate the paths out of the genetic paradigm, touching on scientific, epistemological and sociological aspects of cancer research.

History of anomalies before the era of molecular genetics: The normalization of cancer If so many sequencing results are inconsistent with SMT, why do they not trigger a rethink among cancer researchers? Revisiting an overused idea of the philosopher Thomas Kuhn on how science advances, “anomalies” (findings inconsistent with respect to established knowledge) should have begun a shift long ago in the paradigm of what he calls “normal science” [141]. Anomalies that challenge SMT are not new [28,99,142–145]. Puzzling findings at the organismal level predate the recent wave of hard-to-explain results produced by deep genome sequencing by more than half a century; they question the notion of cancer as a disease of the cell that is irreversibly transformed to a malignant phenotype by genetic alterations. On center stage is the ‘normalization’ of the cancerous cell accomplished by physical contact with a pertinent ‘embryonic field’ [146], which has prompted some researchers to view cancer as a problem of cellular differentiation [146–148]. “Normalization” is perhaps the most prosaic anomaly to the mutation paradigm. When Peter Nowell popularized clonal evolution of cancer cells [2], Beatrice Mintz’s group presented evidence that teratocarcinoma cells injected into mouse embryos (blastocysts) gave rise to cancer-free chimeric mice in which the mutated cancer cells were present in most organs. Such reversion of the malignant phenotype (i.e., normalization) within a proper tissue context has been reproduced in a variety of animal models [149]. Normalization is also observed during the ‘maturation’ of human tumors, whereby proliferating tumor cells sometimes develop into mature, non-proliferating cells, as most clearly seen in neuroblastoma, where cancer cells become ganglion cells [150,151]. In addition, some therapies, including target-selective inhibition of oncogenes aimed at killing cells, often trigger a wave of differentiation of the immature (mutated) cancer cells into specialized postmitotic cells, despite not being designed as differentiation therapy. This is most dramatically apparent in “differentiation syndrome”, the dreaded surge of differentiated neutrophils in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia [152]. Thus, a latent developmental potential of cancer cells is occasionally realized, allowing the cells to (non-genetically) enter a mature state, provided a biological context that opens access to trajectories of physiological development. The old notion of cancer as a differentiation arrest is consistent with the potential for normalization of the malignant phenotype when the appropriate signals relieve the arrest [27,153–157]. Conversely, stressors, notably cytotoxic treatment itself, often cause ‘de-differentiation’ in the cells that survive treatment. As noted in point 10 of Table 1, cell stress can, independent of mutations, induce a stem-like state that confers xenobiotic resistance, reorganize the tumor microenvironment (TME), and promote a (pathological) healing by exploiting developmental fields, all in the absence of Darwinian selection of genetic mutants [158]. The logical inverse of Mintz’s experiments is the work that produced the teratocarcinoma cells used in those very experiments; these cells were generated by implanting normal embryos under the testicular capsule [159]. Later, it was observed that grafting normal (presumably mutation-free) embryonic stem cells into the mouse can produce teratocarcinoma [138]. These historical examples show that both differentiation (or ‘normalization’ if it happens in cancer cells) and de-differentiation (which creates the cancerous stem-like phenotype) are biological processes intimately linked to the existence of cancer. They represent drastic phenotype conversions that lack the characteristic of selective clonal expansion of mutated cells as the agent of pathological change. Instead, phenotypic transitions are controlled by a complex tissue context, which implies the involvement of an array of often poorly understood, coordinated signals.

The cell phenotype as collective actions of genes A new malignant cell phenotype in tumor progression is still often explained by a genetic mutation that follows the conventional ‘one gene—one trait’ scheme. But, as widely noted, there is no simple correspondence (i.e., no 1:1 mapping) between genotype and phenotype [160]; genes directly code for proteins, not phenotypes, and they do not act alone. Gene loci interact with one another, via regulatory proteins that they encode, to collectively produce a cell phenotype [161,162]. The fundamental principle behind the fact that cells within an isogenic (clonal) cell population can have distinct phenotypes, as manifested in the existence of the cell types of the metazoan body, is that cells differ not in their genomes but in their genome-wide configuration of the activities of all gene loci. Such gene activity configurations produce the distinct gene expression patterns or transcriptomes that we can measure and interpret as the molecular basis of cell phenotypes. The multiplicity of cell phenotypes given one same genome obviously defies the tacit assumption of a bijective mapping between genotype and phenotype. Such a relationship is required for Neo-Darwinian logic to work: natural selection enriches a population for a given genotype via a corresponding phenotype to which a fixed ‘fitness’ value is assigned that determines the selection advantage [55,112]. The phenotype diversification that produces the adult cell types from an unchanging genome follows the rules of development that are imposed by the regulatory interactions between the gene loci (and by interactions between the various cells in the tissue). The interactions between the genes are hard-wired in the genomic sequence and collectively form a complex network, the gene regulatory network (GRN), that orchestrates the activities of genes to produce those gene expression patterns that underlie the biologically meaningful phenotypes (Fig 1). Such a “genetic network” was first proposed by Jacob and Monod in the 1960s after they discovered that genes regulate other genes [163]. The central idea, as can be formulated mathematically, is that in coordinating the activities of genes, the GRN tends to interlock them in distinct, self-stabilizing gene expression configurations, called attractor states (valleys in Fig 1B). A key postulate, formulated in 1969 by Stuart Kauffman, is that attractors represent the gene expression patterns that correspond to cell types (or functional cell states) [162,164–166]. Being attractor states, such gene expression patterns are robust to perturbations; they re-establish spontaneously after disturbances, and thus can be inherited across cell generations. The existence of multiple attractor states is a feature of a particular class of complex dynamical systems to which GRNs belong [165]. PPT PowerPoint slide

(B) The new paradigm that explains cell phenotype changes by a concerted change of gene expression: the concept of the gene regulatory network (GRN) with gene-gene interaction mediated by transcription factors (TFs) or regulatory RNAs generalized a “wiring diagram”. It governs the dynamics of gene expression profiles that intuitively (Waddington, left) or with mathematical theory (right) can be represented as a landscape. In the landscape, the attractor states of the GRN, which define stable cell phenotypes, are the valleys. The theory predicts many more attractor states than can be occupied by cells in physiological states (cell types, in gray regions). The unused attractors (red) encode the gene expression profile thought to map into those of cancer cells. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003052.g001 Gene regulatory interactions of a given genome are implemented by transcription factors (TFs), and also by regulatory RNAs and chromosomal configurations. TF proteins and regulatory RNAs bind their targets in a sequence-specific manner. Thus, their regulatory action is highly gene locus-specific and is written in the genome; they collectively define the “wiring diagram” of the GRN (i.e., which gene regulates which genes, and how and under what conditions). The GRN was wired by evolution, e.g., via tuning of TF DNA binding motif sequences (trans-regulation) and their cognate target elements (cis-regulation). This resulted in binding specificities between regulators; such gene expression across all loci was forced into a set of genome-wide patterns, allowing the network to produce attractors (stable patterns) that encode meaningful cell phenotypes. The locus-specific TFs and regulatory RNAs are supported by the non-locus-specific apparatus of epigenetic modification (covalent marks on DNA and histone proteins) that sharpen signals and modulate temporal patterns [167]. Thus, the GRN is a distributed information processing system of mutually regulating genes that form a web of feedback loops—contrary to early views of genetic networks as hierarchical cascades of causation that rigidly link genotype to phenotype [168]. The GRN is not a clockwork. Stochasticity in cell-type diversification had already been proposed by Kupiec in 1983 [161]. Thermal fluctuations of molecule concentrations (due to the small number of molecules in cells) add a layer of non-determinism to the rules of the GRN, allowing attractor states to be represented as probabilities of being occupied [169–171]. This coexistence of deterministic logic and its probabilistic realization permits the definition of a potential-like quantity, which is aptly represented by Waddington’s epigenetic landscape, in which valleys correspond to attractor states and whose depth represent the relative stability of the cell phenotypes that they encode (Fig 2) [172,173]. (For simplicity, but sufficient for this discussion, we deal here only with “fixed-point attractors” and omit more complex dynamical structures, such as “limit cycles”, in which cells are trapped into a closed loop trajectory, such as the cell division cycle [174,175].)

TIFF original image Download: Fig 2. Cancer attractors on the epigenetic landscape. Mathematically, the epigenetic landscape can be extended to regions that represent gene activation configurations (in pink) that exist in theory but are never realized during development and in physiological tissues (green traces descending the hill in the gray regions). The unused regions (pink) contain unoccupied attractors—the cancer attractors. Under abnormal conditions cells can, upon massive perturbation of their gene expression profile, enter such cancer attractors that lack a path to the normal mature cell type attractors (bottom)—and thus are “maturation-arrested” and, if associated gene activation configurations are compatible with cell viability, can become cancerous. Mutations rewire the gene regulatory network (GRN), thus altering the dynamics, which can result in lowering of the barriers (hills) that prevent cells from leaving the physiological regions, facilitating the occupation of cancer attractors. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003052.g002 Now, here is a crucial corollary: on the epigenetic landscape of a given GRN, there exist, for mathematical and network-evolution reasons, many more attractor states than are occupied by cells in the healthy adult organism [176,177]. The phenotype of these unused attractors has been proposed to represent malignant cells [89,178]; in this view, cancer is a possibility immanent to metazoans, and hence is less suited to be seen as “being caused by something”, but rather is primarily the “unleashing of something latent”. Carcinogenesis would then be the accidental entry into these unused latently present attractors, which thus have been referred to as “cancer attractors” [178]. And these must be avoided by normal cells in development and under physiological conditions (Fig 2). This is the reason why the old adage of the molecular biologist that development is “tightly regulated” is more profound than one may think.

Waddington’s epigenetic landscape and cancer attractors In the modern interpretation of the epigenetic landscape, cancer is thus a built-in but normally not realized feature, as epitomized by the unused attractors. Since, in physiological conditions, these attractors are unoccupied, they are not exposed as phenotypes and thus, they are ’not seen’ by natural selection; most of these states would establish gene expression patterns incompatible with life in the modern metazoan tissue. Those few unused attractors that can sustain viable cells in the tissue are not fine-tuned by selection. When occupied by cells that thus, by definition, become neoplastic, cancer attractors would command phenotypes with primordial behaviors not shaped by metazoan evolution to support cell societies that maintain tissue homeostasis [91,179]. In this perspective, cancer would represent atavism (“reversion to an ancestral form”): cancer cells would revive “selfish” protozoan functionalities, however imperfect [88,90,180,181]. More generally speaking, unused attractors represent cell “programs” of the phylogenetic past [182]. The accidental yet highly organized nature of vestigial phenotypes and their consistent reoccurrence is naturally explained by re-occupation of unused attractors that are an integral part of the same epigenetic landscape that is encoded by the genome and governs the unfolding of the normal extant phenotype. (The cancer atavism idea should, in its argumentation logic, not be conflated with the notion of proliferation and motility being the “default state” of cells (discussed in detail later) [91,179,183].) Cancer cells are also stuck in an ontogenetic past. Because unused attractors do not partake in development of later evolved mature tissues, they are more likely to produce developmentally immature, dysfunctional traits that lack fine-tuned efficient homeostasis (mathematically represented by deep, smooth basins of attraction). For instance, being ‘unevolved’, they are likely to lack the sophisticated metazoan capacities to contribute to tissue morphogenesis or to replicate genomes with absolute fidelity. Most importantly, they are not connected by developmental paths to the mature cells’ attractor states (Fig 2, right). Such paths were carved by evolution (via GRN wiring) into the epigenetic landscape to ensure that normal immature cells respond to appropriate tissue signals during development and efficiently differentiate, while being shielded from undue entry into the unevolved cancer attractors (green curved arrows in Fig 2). Once trapped in such attractors of imperfect homeostasis, cells are easily perturbed by hypoxic, inflamed and or otherwise stressed stroma [184], all of which are known to cause genome and epigenomic instability, resulting in genetic alterations, further promoted by the absence of optimized DNA repair systems [185,186]. The immaturity of these cells places them closer to early developmental stages, in line with their expression of embryonic cell traits, such as accelerated cell division, multi-lineage potency, tolerance to genomic instability and xenobiotics—all features shared by cancer cells. Having scant access to the physiological attractors of differentiated cell state [89] (Fig 2), cells in cancer attractors are also incapable of differentiation, hence the pathologists’ notion of maturation arrest [148]. The ‘accidental’ entry into cancer attractors does not depend on a specific mutation; instead, all kinds on non-genetic stressors that produce particular non-physiological, unstable gene expression patterns, amplified by stochastic fluctuations of transcriptomes, can trigger exit from normal cell type attractors and entry into a nearby cancer attractor (see point 10, Table 1).

Rethinking the concept of genetic causality for cancer The concept of accidental entry of cells into a latently existing but undesired attractor and then being trapped in it, supports the notion of cancer as a process of unspecific “unleashing” (of a potential) rather than of specific “de novo causation”. Cancer attractors explain the unfathomable diversity of molecular disruptions and perturbations that all can accidentally trigger the entry into them and produce, as if orchestrated by an invisible hand, a specific gene activation configuration that governs the cancerous phenotype. These disruptions can result from an immense diversity of random genetic alterations that affect proteins of a variety of functional classes [21] or from a vast array of defects in regulatory interactions, from the rewiring of gene–gene interactions by genomic translocations (including creating novel fusion proteins or swapping promoters), the dysregulation of non-coding RNAs and RNA splicing, to altered function of broadly acting epigenetic and chromatin-modifying regulators. The immense diversity of mechanisms, all accidental, that can converge to producing the cancerous phenotype with minimal help by Darwinian selection, is perhaps the most prosaic yet profound manifestation of cancer attractors as latent structures in dark regions of the vast state space of gene activation patterns. So, if genetic alterations are involved, what is our criticism of the claim of a genetic cause of cancer in the current paradigm? Cancer cannot be explained by explicit genetic causation in the traditional sense of “a gene X for that phenotype Y” being defective, as is readily achieved for mendelian diseases. Instead, we need to consider the collective action of genes, which we now can formalize with the epigenetic landscape, as well as cell population dynamics and tissue context. The landscape provides a formalism that places the role of a genetic anomaly for tumorigenesis in a new light: genetic mutations essentially alter the GRN wiring. In mathematical models that map the wiring diagram to the landscape topography, a localized GRN change (a point mutation or a larger scale rearrangement) is a localized rewiring and will most often just gently distort the topography of the landscape. There are only so many ways a landscape can gently change its shape (while still ensuring viability)—and one typical way is by altering the barrier height that separate the attractors. Such a distortion in turn affects the cell trajectories. For instance, it could facilitate the accidental entry into a cancer attractor from a given place in the normal trajectory, driven by molecular noise or non-mutagenic environmental stress (details in [55,158]). It is in this convoluted sense that one can admit that genetic mutations can “cause” cancer. Despite the absence of developmental paths to normal mature states, the epigenetic landscape still grants cells in cancer attractors an intrinsic potential for normalization, as manifested in the rare reversion of the cancerous phenotype under particular experimental conditions [153,155,156,187,188]. The reversion potential is rarely realized because very distinct tissue constellations are required to overcome the energy barrier to exit the cancer attractor, as seen in the particular instance of neuroblastoma that can spontaneously normalize. The difficulty of normalization is consistent with the limited success of differentiation therapy [189,190] and with the exceeding rarity of “spontaneous remission” of cancer despite the theoretical reversibility of cell states [191]. We can now more precisely articulate an indirect, convoluted role of genetic mutations in cancer to reconcile with the SMT view. Both the genetic paradigm of cancer and Neo-Darwinism rest on the tacit assumption of a 1:1 mapping between genotype and phenotype [192]. In this view, one must, by logical necessity, explain any phenotypic change by a genetic mutation. But, as computer simulations have suggested, most mutations in the core GRN (which in principle alter the wiring of the GRN) do not qualitatively affect the topography of the epigenetic landscape (e.g., they typically do not destroy or create attractor states), but as said above, cause a gentle distortion. Thus, the majority of mutations, even those that alter gene activity, are readily buffered away. However, mild distortions due to GRN rewiring can alter the relative stabilities of attractors, and thus may affect transition rates between attractors (e.g., stem cell and differentiated state and senescent states), including rates for epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT)[193,194] and entry to the unused attractors [195,196]. Altered transition rates in turn lead to imbalances in tissue homeostasis. One manifestation is the widely observed trans-differentiation event (lineage switching, “lineage infidelity”) seen in malignancy. As to the much-needed higher-level organismal biology view of cancer as a complex disease, a first step towards organicism is in the interpretation of large-scale genomic alterations as the source of cell physiological and not genetic informational departure from the norm. Aneuploidy and polyploidy in cancer cells [197] often result in the formation of polyploid giant cancer cells that are found in nearly half of all high-grade cancers [198]. Polyploidy and associated expression of meiotic genes in malignant cells offer a link between cancer biology and organismal biology at a larger timescale and could represent a rather generic alternative attractor that is often accessed by tumorigenic dysregulation of the GRN. In fact, since tumors often reactivate diapause and gametogenesis programs that mark the entry into a new sexual reproduction cycle and epitomize the immortality of the germline, it has been hypothesized that cancer may recapitulate, albeit in an aberrant and abortive manner, the life cycle of organisms [180,199,200]. Finally, beyond its putative role in generating mutations (and neoantigens) [201], there are also organismal consequences of genomic instability (the “mutator phenotype”), which itself is more likely a consequence of the abnormal phenotype produced by unevolved attractors than the needed source of cancer-causing mutations. Indeed, the idea of what actually “came first” was articulated by Richmond Prehn: “…it may be more correct to say that cancers beget mutations than it is to say that mutations beget cancers” [202]. Then, we shall also remember the physical, not informational consequences of genome instability: the DNA repair response triggered by genomic instabilities produces unphysiological DNA configurations (breakpoints, stalled replication forks, RNA–DNA hybrids, double- and single-stranded DNA, etc.) that leak into the cytoplasm, which in turn, mistaken for viral invasion, activates stress and inflammatory responses via the NFkB and STING/interferon pathways, thus affecting the cell’s microenvironment [203,204]. This brings us to the tissue level processes.

Cancer as a tissue-based disease: The tissue organization field theory of carcinogenesis The interpretation of genome sequence-based lineage reconstruction (Table 1, point 6) defaults to the view that the tumor originates from a single cell, the “initiating” or “founder”, cancer cell. This is correct in a fundamental, almost trivial way because a group of cells always has a common ancestor—it just depends on how far back one traces the pedigree (up to the zygote). The idea of one initiating cell in which the truncal (“tumor initiating”) mutation in the clonal tree happened, making it a founder cell [36], ignores that its outgrowth has to depend on its neighboring cells (normal or transformed) that provide the critical tissue context for it to survive and also ignores the multiplicity of distinct cell phenotypes within an isogenic clone. Conversely, not all cells that contain that same early mutation (that would allow for later oncogenic, otherwise lethal mutations to accumulate) will become cancerous—see Table 1, points 6 and 7 [108]. Empirical evidence contradicting the view of “cancer as a disease of the cell” was already available over 60 years ago, when David W. Smithers published an essay entitled “An Attack to Cytologism” [205]. Smithers refuted the idea that cancer originates from an abnormal cell. His and others’ observations suggested that cancer is not a disease that starts from a single tumor-initiating cell, but rather an anomaly of tissue organization (Fig 3). (This argument only proposes that it is not as simple as postulating “a” cancer cell but does not deny the existence of individual cells with enhanced potential to drive tumor growth).

TIFF original image Download: Fig 3. Cancer as a disease of the tissue, not the cell. (A) The paradigm of abnormal cells as the source of tumors. (B) The new paradigm of cancer as a disease of the tissue, explained by schematics of seminal experiments that establish the phenomenon of normalization of cancerous cells by the stroma, as well as the converse, i.e., the initiation of tumor from “healthy cells” due to carcinogenic stressors acting on the stroma. Note that this second paradigm shift implicitly requires non-genetic plasticity of cancer cells, as proposed in the first paradigm shift (Fig 1). In the traditional paradigm, plasticity is assumed only for the (non-transformed) stromal cells. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003052.g003 A compelling Illustration of the need for a tissue-based rather than cell-centric view is the finding that while a bulk injection of hepatocarcinoma cells into the liver generates a liver tumor, injection of the same amounts of the same cell type into the spleen, which distributes transplanted cells individually throughout the liver, fails to generate a tumor [153]. Importantly, the cells injected into the spleen became normalized in the liver by direct contact with their neighboring normal hepatic cells and were incorporated into the liver’s normal structure, underscoring the role of non-genetic, environment-regulated cell phenotype plasticity at the demarcation between normalcy and neoplasia [154,206]. These observations led to the concept that there is no “cancer cell” [101] because cells declared as such (e.g., because of canonical oncogenic mutations) behave as normal cells (Table 1, Point 2). Instead, cancer can be broadly understood as “development gone awry”. Within this perspective, the tissue organization field theory is based on two principles that unite phylogenesis and ontogenesis. Firstly, the default state of all cells is constitutive proliferation with variation and motility. Therefore, proliferation and motility do not require an explanation; instead, what ought to be explained is why cells do not proliferate and move. Secondly, cancer is a tissue-based disease, whereby the tissue organization constraints to the default state of its cells are weakened. Consequently, cells become freed to express their default state, thus proliferating, generating variation and moving. This explains tumor growth by accrual of new cells, as well as invasion and metastasis [91,102]. The other major facet of carcinogenesis as a tissue-level phenomenon pertains to the role of ‘non-cancerous’ cells in the TME or the stroma. The idea that the TME, consisting of extracellular matrix (ECM), mesenchymal cells, and resident and invading immune cells, plays a role in carcinogenesis was accepted by the cancer community only in the 1990s, despite pointed reference by the pathologist Rudolph Virchow more than 150 years ago [207]. The all too obvious role of the TME in carcinogenesis, which involves angiogenesis, inflammation, immune suppression and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) [208], soon led to exploding research funding in this area. However, the stromal component has mostly been seen as a necessary enabler and rarely as a driver of carcinogenesis. It provided the biological embodiment of the convenient notion of context that is often invoked to mitigate anomalies plaguing the SMT. Throughout the 20th century, carcinogenesis was considered a genetic disease of the cancer cell despite accumulating experimental evidence pointing to a causative role of the stroma [209]. For example, the fact that injection of a chemical carcinogen administered intraperitoneally generates mammary cancers in susceptible rat strains has been attributed to mutations caused by the carcinogen in the glandular epithelial cells, such as Ha-ras-1 (details below) [210]. However, all cells of the organism are exposed to the carcinogen. From a developmental biology perspective, the question is, which is the target of the carcinogen: the epithelium, the stroma or both?

Lessons from organogenesis To understand the relationship between the stroma (the “support” scaffold of an organ) and the parenchyma (the “functional” part of the organ) in cancer, we shall review the process of organogenesis [211,212]. The genesis of tissues and organs entails complex reciprocal interactions between the components of the morphogenetic field defined by a distinct 3D array of cells that gives rise to an autonomous tissue structure or organ [213]. Numerous epithelium/mesenchyme recombination experiments have shown that it is the mesenchyme that determines the type of skin adnexa; for example, wing mesenchyme dictates the presence of chicken feathers regardless of whether it is recombined with epidermis from foot or wing, and scales appear regardless of the origin of the epidermis if recombined with mesenchyme of the foot [214]. Similarly, the branching pattern of the epithelium of salivary and mammary glands is determined by the stroma of the organ [215]. As in organogenesis, the stroma is equally as important in tumorigenesis. When mammary epithelial cells were exposed in vitro either to the mutagenic carcinogen N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU), or to vehicle before being transplanted into the mammary stroma of rats surgically cleared of epithelium [145,183], carcinogenesis only occurred when the stroma was exposed in vivo to NMU, regardless of whether or not the epithelial cells were exposed to the carcinogen (Fig 3). Mammary epithelial cells exposed in vitro to the carcinogen formed phenotypically normal ducts when injected into unexposed stroma. Mutations in the Ha-ras-1 gene, which was assumed to be the cause of cancerization [210], did not correlate with initiation of neoplasia: not only was it often found in both cleared mammary fat pads of vehicle-treated animals and intact mammary glands of untreated animals, but it was also absent in various carcinomas. Such tissue recombination experiments show that the stroma is a crucial target of the carcinogen, while the epithelium is not, and that in this case, mutation in the Ha-ras-1 gene is neither necessary nor sufficient for neoplastic development [216]. A comparable experiment showed that radiation-induced changes in mammary gland stroma contributed to the neoplastic progression of non-irradiated, quasi-normal (TP53-mutated but non-tumorigenic) mammary epithelial cells [217]. Finally, nontumorigenic human prostatic epithelial cells from benign prostate hyperplasia develops into tumors when recombined with prostate cancer stroma and not with normal stroma [218,219]. Recent stromal-epithelial tissue recombinant culture systems and single-cell transcriptomics have begun to unravel the molecular signals that mediate such stromal tumorigenic effects [220]. Not only can carcinogenesis be initiated by injuring the stroma, but a normal stroma can also act as a gate-keeper of neoplastic development by constraining cells belonging to a neoplasm to behave as the normal cells of the organ that form normal tissue structures [221]. The experimental normalization of mutated cells that were once part of a tumor has been reported for a variety of cancer types, among them melanoma (by the neural crest [222]), hepatocarcinoma (by normal liver [223]), or mammary cancer (by normal mammary gland [27,221,224–226]). A compelling demonstration of a tumor-restraining role of stroma is the case of localized pancreatic cancer, where targeting of (originally considered tumor-promoting) CAFs resulted in tumor progression and invasion [227–229]. Intriguingly, the same chemically inert material can cause tumors in animals when implanted as rods but not when injected as powder of the same material and same mass [230]. This suggests that chronic wounding and/or mechanical stress of the tissue causes carcinogenesis through breakdown of physical tissue architecture in the absence of genotoxicity, something that has long been observed in multiple cancer models, underscoring the importance of tissue fields [231–234]. In the light of the central role of the mesenchyme on the determination of the parenchyma phenotype, it is unsurprising to see the surge of data showing a tumor-promoting effect of altered stroma, most notably, ECM composition, fibroblast phenotype (in the form of CAFs) and tumor-promoting chronic inflammation [209]. While these findings have triggered a massive quest for underlying chemical mediators, one should not forget that tissue organization plays not just a supporting, but a determinant role. The organicist perspective [138] is based on the interdependency of the organism and its organs. It recognizes a circular causal regimen by closure of constraints that makes parts interdependent [235], wherein these constraints are not only molecules, but also biophysical force [236]. Since such a view encompasses tissues not simply as collectives of cells but as emergent anatomical and functional organized entities, it affords little opportunity for discrete molecular targeting, limiting its appeal to reductionist research programs in search of a molecular ‘silver bullet’.

Explaining anomalies in cancer biology under the SMT paradigm A common way of explaining the lack of fit between the SMT and data has been to invoke involvement of biological processes not obviously related to oncogenic mutations, such as cellular metabolism, stromal alterations, bacterial and viral carcinogenesis, immune surveillance, etc. that we have characterized as “compromises”. In such hybridization of explanations, old ideas are kept intact, such as the claim that cancer is a disease of the cell and that a normal cell is rendered cancerous by genetic alterations. Justifications often include epimutations [237] due to altered epigenetic marks (epigenetic reprogramming) or references to the old dualism between initiator (mutagenic) and promoter (non-mutagenic) [238]. The concept of dividing the cause of cancer into the initiator, which is the mutagenic event, and the promoter, a chronic (chemical) stress by typically non-genotoxic agents, has been proposed based on the classical experiments of skin carcinogenesis, first performed a century ago. Mice subjected to chemicals known to be mutagenic will develop skin cancer only after ensuing repeated treatment with a non-genotoxic irritant, such as croton oil or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetra-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) [192]. Recent genomic sequence analyses reveal that the initial carcinogen indeed caused genetic alterations, which remain silent until application of TPA at a later time point. After TPA treatment, development of papillomas and carcinomas was observed [239]. The elegance of the concept in its modern reincarnation is that the promoter is now understood to not only exert its effect on the mutated cells via non-genetic phenotype switching, but also on the TME via tumorigenic inflammation. The initiator-promoter model is often used to explain the well-known fact that a large fraction of listed carcinogens is non-mutagenic; they may apparently cause cancer by triggering outgrowth of occult mutated cancerous cells. However, this picture is still too simplistic, exemplifying the aforementioned hybridization of old ideas with new findings. At its core, it still maintains a primary causative role of genetic mutations in a single cancer initiating cell, followed by a sequence of causal steps. The qualitative dichotomy between a mutagenic initiator that creates ’cancer cells’ and the non-genetic, tissue-perturbing promoter that expands them may not be as clear-cut. Indeed, the reverse experiment (first treatment with the promoter followed by the initiator) equally produces tumors [240]. This result refutes the classical model that requires that the mutagenic (alleged) initiator must act first. Instead, the reverse experiment suggests merely a synergism between initiator and promoter, albeit a complex one that must involve tissue memory of non-mutagenic perturbations. The promoter/initiator framework by itself is an interesting model, but further investigation should be conducted through the lens of non-genetic dynamics, tissue organization (including the TME) and organismal biology. Another aspect that has been invoked to alleviate the discrepancies between genome sequencing results and the SMT is epigenetic reprogramming [241]. A solid, formal explanation for enduring changes in the landscape of cell phenotype would have to consider the dynamics of GRNs because epigenetic marks themselves are not explanatory; they are reversible, and the epigenetic modifiers that place these marks are not locus-specific and must be guided by the GRN to coordinate gene loci activities to produce coherent expression patterns that can be locked-in (attractors) [162,167]. Moreover, the attractor stability of a cell phenotype can be disrupted by drastic changes in its microenvironment that affect a large number of regulatory genes to overcome attractor dynamics. This property is evident in the recombination studies with fetal mesenchyme, underscoring the strong leverage that tissue level interactions and tissue architecture possess in perturbing the GRN at multiple points to trigger attractor destabilization and transitions [231,242,243]. Interestingly, the hybridization of concepts to accommodate anomalies is also present in the extended list of the ‘Hallmarks of cancer’. Indeed, hallmarks only serve as attachment points for tenuous molecular causes, dictated by Dennett’s “greedy” reductionism, namely the recourse by scientists to “underestimate the complexities, trying to skip whole layers or levels of theory in their rush to fasten everything securely and neatly to the foundation” [206]. This attitude became evident in the latest installment of the “Hallmarks of cancer” listing [111] that, instead of biological thinking, uses the existence of mutated genetic pathways to motivate new hallmarks that by necessity are explained by them. Notwithstanding, the two new hallmarks, “Unlocking phenotypic plasticity” and “Non-mutational epigenetic programming”, are non-genetic, with ironic redundancy between them [111].

Conclusions and outlook Dealing with a complex world, philosophers of science talk about auxiliary hypotheses, which are readily erected using known facts. These abound because complex systems contain a web of causal interactions, as epitomized by the living organism. They offer an uncountable set of auxiliary explanations that can rescue any existing paradigm and not only renders the falsification of a hypothesis meaningless [244,245] but also its defense by excuse arguments. Put differently, the genetic paradigm of cancer is a vague theory and, as the physicist Richard Feynman stated, vague theories cannot be disproven [246], which is even more true for as complex a processes as carcinogenesis. Therefore, interpretation of empirical results guided by formal theory based on some set of first principles, and undaunted by dogmas, is ever more important in an era of easy data acquisition. Over the years, many proposals outside the paradigm of cancer as a genetic disease have been offered in view of the accumulating findings pointing to shortcomings of the SMT. Some scientists in the SMT camp—still a minority—now begin to embrace a pluralistic view. For instance, we must recall Mike Stratton’s quote in the opening section of this Essay. After his team failed to find mutational signatures specific to endemic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, he concluded: “We have found evidence that chemicals might be able to work in different ways other than directly causing mutations to increase a person’s chances of developing cancer. We will have to rethink our ideas about the way in which some cancers develop. It is a crucial lesson” [205]. We hope that such “crucial lessons” will not be ignored. Pursuing a rigorous explanation of carcinogenesis entails identification of fundamental biological principles placed within a consistent formal theoretical framework, instead of more terminological acrobatics centered around observed altered molecular pathways. As Darwin pointed out to a friend in 1821, if one were “only to observe, not theorise… [one] might as well go into a gravel-pit and count the pebbles and describe their colours. How odd it is that everyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view, if it is to be of any service” [247]. Theories do not need to be right; they are a practical tool to conduct research. If Darwin’s pebbles are today’s molecular alterations in tumors, then we must not simply be satisfied with their categorization in a system of ingredients that cause tumors, as illustrated by the proposed hallmarks. We must rather regard the hallmarks merely as manifestations of fundamental principles of living organisms. An epistemic shift towards a biological theory of cancer may still be an uphill battle in the current climate of thought created by the ease of data collection and a culture of research that discourages ’disruptive science’ [248]. Here, we have made an argument for dropping the SMT and its epicycles. We presented new and old but sidelined theoretical alternatives to the SMT that embrace theory and organismal biology and can guide experiments and data interpretation. We expect that the diminishing returns from the ceaselessly growing databases of somatic mutations, the equivalent to Darwin’s gravel pit, may soon reach a pivot point. In addition, we hope that then the adherents of the genetic paradigm of cancer will begin to expand their vista on cancer in a profound way.

In this prevailing paradigm, tumorigenesis is caused by cancer-driving somatic mutations and clonal expansion. However, results from tumor sequencing, motivated by the genetic paradigm itself, create apparent ‘paradoxes’ that are not conducive to a pure SMT. But beyond genetic causation, the new results lend credence to old ideas from organismal biology. To resolve inconsistencies between the genetic paradigm of cancer and biological reality, we must complement deep sequencing with deep thinking: embrace formal theory and historicity of biological entities, and (re)consider non-genetic plasticity of cells and tissues. In this Essay, we discuss the concepts of cell state dynamics and tissue fields that emerge from the collective action of genes and of cells in their morphogenetic context, respectively, and how they help explain inconsistencies in the data in the context of SMT.

The latter attitude cements paradigms, and paradigms are amplified by any new-looking glass that puts one’s way of seeing the world on steroids. In cancer research, such a self-fulfilling prophecy has been fueled by next-generation DNA sequencing. The ease of access to sequencing has stimulated the unfettered quest for genetic alterations in tumor cells that would explain cancer. Since the 1970s, the elevation of the concept of ‘cancer as a genetic disease’ has been driven by a number of factors, including discoveries of cancer-associated mutations, narrowly gene-engineered mouse models, funding policies that follow crowd thinking, and the promise of targeted therapy. The propensity of the human mind to cling to simple, mechanistically plausible explanations further promoted narratives of oncogenic ‘driver mutations’ . The somatic mutation theory (SMT) and its tacit claim to represent the “truth” on the origin of cancer is concisely articulated in this quotation by M. Stratton and L. Alexandrov from a decade ago: “All cancers originate from a single cell that starts to behave abnormally due to the acquired somatic mutations in its genome” (2014). This quotation dates back to 2014—and we will present an updated 2024 version later. However, during the past decade, widespread acceptance of the SMT has driven the use of next-generation sequencing. With lowering costs of genome analysis, the genetic paradigm led to ‘precision oncology’; but targeting driver mutations has invariably met the challenge of relapse of treatment-resistant cancer, too fast and in far more aggressive form than can be explained by selection for new mutants. Knowing the mutational profile of a patient’s tumor genome has yielded little benefit in ‘personalized/precision’ cancer care . Ironically, over the past years, the same sequencing technology has exposed new cracks in the edifice of the cancer genetics paradigm. Table 1 summarizes the most salient findings that challenge the paradigm. Some sequencing results are compatible with the postulate of oncogenic mutations, but many inconvenient findings are overlooked for lack of critical discourse, resulting in an unbalanced view. Thus, an open discussion of the growing sequencing data that are contradictory to the genetic paradigm is due. The (apparent) paradox goes both ways: many cancers harbor no consistent driver mutations, while canonical oncogenic mutations are found in tissues that remain free of cancer (see Table 1 for references). Paradoxes, according to Nils Bohr, are of course central for progress —if properly recognized. PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Download: Table 1. ‘Paradoxical’ findings regarding the genetic paradigm of cancer uncovered by sequencing technology. Large-scale cancer genome sequencing endeavors, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) , launched in 2006 by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, have uncovered a mesmerizing breadth of genetic mutations associated with cancer. The vast, nearly chaotic diversity of genetic alterations found within the same nominal tumor type between patients is staggering and questions a deterministic logic of causation of cancer by mutations in oncogenic pathways (Table 1). However, patterns, such as recurrent mutational signatures and chromosomal rearrangements, are characteristic for distinct tumor types and stages and point to a complex interplay between stochastic elements and some rule-governed biological causation. The immense diversity of functions of the (mutated) molecular pathways allegedly linked to cancer causation , and the fact that cancer is a robust, universal phenomenon amongst metazoans, tells a story of principles of development and evolution of multi-cellular life behind the very existence and the near- inevitability of neoplasia, transcending phylogenesis, ontogenesis and oncogenesis . However, in the quest for predictive biomarkers and molecular targets, the cancer research community has abandoned deep thinking for deep sequencing, interpreting data through the lens of clinical translation detached from fundamental biology. The core of the genetic paradigm: Somatic Darwinian evolution To revisit the role of mutations in carcinogenesis, we need to recall a central corollary of the cancer genetics paradigm that links somatic mutations to the cancer phenotype and cancer progression: namely, the idea of somatic Darwinian evolution of the mutated cells. Herein, random mutations may (by chance) confer functional advantages, e.g., promote autonomous proliferation that increase cell “fitness” . Then, under natural selection in the cell population, those cells carrying mutations that confer a “fitter” phenotype would clonally expand, with the “fittest” clone (derived from a single cell) eventually taking over the population. This Neo-Darwinian scheme is applied to tumors in a loose, qualitative, if not figurative manner , often departing from rigorous concepts of evolutionary biology, and eventually becoming known as the SMT . The idea of SMT has its origin in 1914 when the embryologist Theodor Boveri proposed that cancer originates from chromatin alterations in a cell. It was later recast in terms of accumulation of a number of genetic mutations by Bauer and Nordling in the 1950s , implying a need for increased cellular proliferation that is acquired as a novel trait—but still without invoking Darwinian positive selection. The concept of carcinogenesis as an explicit process of (somatic) evolution in the Neo-Darwinian sense was popularized by Nowell’s seminal paper in 1976 . However, he introduced a pluralistic view: “…this correlation between observable genetic change and tumor progression does not, of course, prove causality, and some workers believe that at least some aspects of the evolutionary process, (…) may represent epigenetic, rather than genetic phenomena.” These cautionary words have been largely left out of the equation of cancer genetics in the following 50 years. Despite its rapid ascendance, SMT remains a conjecture supported by spotty, selective evidence rather than a precisely formulated theory, notwithstanding its use of mathematical formalisms . Specifically, SMT left out broader considerations of historicity (ontogenesis and phylogenesis) and physiology. First, autonomous proliferation appears to be a latent ‘default’ state, ‘baked-in’ in organismal existence already in the last universal common ancestor, and is not an evolutionary novelty that is attained through natural selection in the tissue . Second, expansion of faster proliferating cell clones is not limited to tumors, as evident in aging normal tissue and chronic diseases where hyperproliferation results in oligo-clonal expansion . Yet, convenient for its simplicity, but misleading in its meaning, the Neo-Darwinian principle has become the unquestioned truth in tumor biology which, as Table 1 shows, is responsible for many of the cracks in the genetic paradigm of cancer. Robust manifestation of natural selection in tumors would be ‘hard selective sweeps’ : the complete overtaking of the tumor cell population by a malignant clone carrying the driver mutation (along with linked, but neutral mutations), representing one step in Vogelstein’s multi-step progression model of linear evolution . The genetic fixation (as it is called in population genetics, see Table 1, point 6) of the oncogenic allele in the tumor cell population would be required for the logics of precision oncology that seeks to target a mutation to eradicate a tumor. In reality, a tumor contains thousands of genetically distinct, apparently independent cell clones, giving rise to genetic intra-tumor heterogeneity that came as a shock to the precision oncology world . This finding led to attempts of adjusting precision oncology by targeting “trunk mutations” shared by every cancer cell and by combination therapy directed against multiple oncogenic mutations—approaches that still adhere to SMT . But, even if a clone appears to expand faster and dominate the tumor, there is little proof that a complex tumor phenotype is sculpted by natural selection for specific oncogenic mutations that produce said ‘adaptive traits’ as Neo-Darwinism postulates. It is likely correct that simple Darwinian evolution is at display in the case of evasion from targeted therapy, notably kinase inhibitor drugs , wherein a point mutation in the kinase protein interferes with multiple aspects of kinase activity energetics, as best studied in the oncoprotein CBR-Abl, as it becomes resistant to the highly selective inhibitor imatinib . But, adaptive selection of such molecular phenotype is a far cry from the suggested generation of complex traits that embody the “hallmarks of cancer” by natural selection during tumor progression. Thus, SMT suffers from the same shortcoming as Neo-Darwinian evolution in that it only explains distinct localized adaptive traits obviously linked to the selection pressure but not the emergence of complex, higher-order biological functions. One must also not forget that neutral variants can be enriched without being selected for (Table 1, points 5, 6) because of (random) genetic drift in relatively small cell populations. In finite cell populations the mathematics of random birth-death processes alone accounts for highly skewed allele frequency distributions that defy our numerical intuition (“the rich get richer—without being more capable”) , although neutral drift may be overestimated because of late appearing subclonal driver mutations . Complicating the picture of somatic evolution are interactions at a higher level, like those between subclones of cancer cells that affect fitness of the entire tumor , creating non-cell autonomous dynamics . Beyond direct mutual stimulation, the distinct clones may functionally complement each other because of their ‘specialist’ capabilities that support the cancer cell community, for instance, through metabolism that alters pH and nutrients in the intercellular space, detoxification, promotion of angiogenesis, alteration of tissue mechanics , or averting anti-tumor immunity. These biological functions are not sufficient to grow a tumor themselves. Conversely, some tumor cells may keep their more malignant neighbors at bay and must not be killed . Thus, if we view the tumor as an evolving ecosystem, as has become fashionable, we also must embrace evolutionary/ecological principles that have emerged in the past few decades and that question the dominance of the simple scheme of ‘natural selection’ of Neo-Darwinism . These include punctuated equilibrium (stasis with sudden bursts of evolutionary events) , group selection (for fitness of a group due to social behaviors) , niche construction (evolving organism modifies its own selective environment) and structuralism (natural selection must obey constraints of physics, chemistry and geometry, etc. which contribute to shaping the phenotype with no selection) . Of particular relevance is the group of evolutionary theories that emphasize phenotypic plasticity . These theories all suggest that the direction of evolutionary adaptation of populations ‘tracks’ the physiological adaptation of the individual to its environment as enabled by regulated phenotype plasticity, such as acclimatization. These theories include genetic assimilation/genomic accommodation , the Baldwin effect and canalization , and phenotype-first dynamics . These mutation-less mechanisms may ‘lubricate’ and channel natural selection; thus, they actually support Darwinian natural selection by making evolution of adaptive traits more likely in view of the ‘unlikely’ mutations that need to happen. Thus, despite being largely absent in SMT literature, all these theories indirectly support Darwinism by considering non-genetic plasticity, thereby relaxing the rigid one-genotype-one-phenotype constraint. Overcoming the limitations of the current paradigm: Expand it or replace it? Calls for overcoming the blinders of the genetic paradigm have a long history. What is new is that, first, the same omics technologies employed to identify new oncogenic mutations have also been used to better understand non-genetic processes in tumorigenesis that involve cell plasticity and tissue organization. And second, the quest for drug targets or biomarkers have meanwhile reduced much of cancer research from a scholarly biological discipline to a transactional operation concerned more with cataloguing molecular alterations and finding associations, than with understanding fundamental principles using formal theory . The zest for intellectual discourse on the nature of cancer, the type of scholarly discourse that advances all scientific disciplines, is long gone, or viewed upon with suspicion. Since one should not postulate the end of a paradigm without specifying the ‘alternatives’ that may correct or replace it, we will discuss here two sets of ideas that have been sidelined by the dominance of the genetic paradigm of cancer. First, that “cancer is not a disease of the genes”, but of gene regulation and thus, of the cell. We must consider the dynamics of the collective action of genes in a network that governs cell behaviors. Second, that ‘cancer is not a disease of the cell’, but of tissues ; we must consider principles of tissue organization. Both of these ‘alternatives’ are discussed in detail below. To interpret observations afforded by powerful new technologies, we more than ever need a solid framework grounded in biological principles that must be rigorously formulated (but may not yet be mathematically formalized) . Cancer research needs to return from current transactional activities to the scholarly investigations enjoyed by generations of biologists who have placed new findings in the context of organisms, their development, physiology and evolution . As Philip Ball points out, the apparent lack of ‘progress’ in the biological sciences may be related to the adoption of a mistaken paradigm . Herein, we will illuminate the paths out of the genetic paradigm, touching on scientific, epistemological and sociological aspects of cancer research. History of anomalies before the era of molecular genetics: The normalization of cancer If so many sequencing results are inconsistent with SMT, why do they not trigger a rethink among cancer researchers? Revisiting an overused idea of the philosopher Thomas Kuhn on how science advances, “anomalies” (findings inconsistent with respect to established knowledge) should have begun a shift long ago in the paradigm of what he calls “normal science” . Anomalies that challenge SMT are not new . Puzzling findings at the organismal level predate the recent wave of hard-to-explain results produced by deep genome sequencing by more than half a century; they question the notion of cancer as a disease of the cell that is irreversibly transformed to a malignant phenotype by genetic alterations. On center stage is the ‘normalization’ of the cancerous cell accomplished by physical contact with a pertinent ‘embryonic field’ , which has prompted some researchers to view cancer as a problem of cellular differentiation . “Normalization” is perhaps the most prosaic anomaly to the mutation paradigm. When Peter Nowell popularized clonal evolution of cancer cells , Beatrice Mintz’s group presented evidence that teratocarcinoma cells injected into mouse embryos (blastocysts) gave rise to cancer-free chimeric mice in which the mutated cancer cells were present in most organs. Such reversion of the malignant phenotype (i.e., normalization) within a proper tissue context has been reproduced in a variety of animal models . Normalization is also observed during the ‘maturation’ of human tumors, whereby proliferating tumor cells sometimes develop into mature, non-proliferating cells, as most clearly seen in neuroblastoma, where cancer cells become ganglion cells . In addition, some therapies, including target-selective inhibition of oncogenes aimed at killing cells, often trigger a wave of differentiation of the immature (mutated) cancer cells into specialized postmitotic cells, despite not being designed as differentiation therapy. This is most dramatically apparent in “differentiation syndrome”, the dreaded surge of differentiated neutrophils in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia . Thus, a latent developmental potential of cancer cells is occasionally realized, allowing the cells to (non-genetically) enter a mature state, provided a biological context that opens access to trajectories of physiological development. The old notion of cancer as a differentiation arrest is consistent with the potential for normalization of the malignant phenotype when the appropriate signals relieve the arrest . Conversely, stressors, notably cytotoxic treatment itself, often cause ‘de-differentiation’ in the cells that survive treatment. As noted in point 10 of Table 1, cell stress can, independent of mutations, induce a stem-like state that confers xenobiotic resistance, reorganize the tumor microenvironment (TME), and promote a (pathological) healing by exploiting developmental fields, all in the absence of Darwinian selection of genetic mutants . The logical inverse of Mintz’s experiments is the work that produced the teratocarcinoma cells used in those very experiments; these cells were generated by implanting normal embryos under the testicular capsule . Later, it was observed that grafting normal (presumably mutation-free) embryonic stem cells into the mouse can produce teratocarcinoma . These historical examples show that both differentiation (or ‘normalization’ if it happens in cancer cells) and de-differentiation (which creates the cancerous stem-like phenotype) are biological processes intimately linked to the existence of cancer. They represent drastic phenotype conversions that lack the characteristic of selective clonal expansion of mutated cells as the agent of pathological change. Instead, phenotypic transitions are controlled by a complex tissue context, which implies the involvement of an array of often poorly understood, coordinated signals. The cell phenotype as collective actions of genes A new malignant cell phenotype in tumor progression is still often explained by a genetic mutation that follows the conventional ‘one gene—one trait’ scheme. But, as widely noted, there is no simple correspondence (i.e., no 1:1 mapping) between genotype and phenotype ; genes directly code for proteins, not phenotypes, and they do not act alone. Gene loci interact with one another, via regulatory proteins that they encode, to collectively produce a cell phenotype . The fundamental principle behind the fact that cells within an isogenic (clonal) cell population can have distinct phenotypes, as manifested in the existence of the cell types of the metazoan body, is that cells differ not in their genomes but in their genome-wide configuration of the activities of all gene loci. Such gene activity configurations produce the distinct gene expression patterns or transcriptomes that we can measure and interpret as the molecular basis of cell phenotypes. The multiplicity of cell phenotypes given one same genome obviously defies the tacit assumption of a bijective mapping between genotype and phenotype. Such a relationship is required for Neo-Darwinian logic to work: natural selection enriches a population for a given genotype via a corresponding phenotype to which a fixed ‘fitness’ value is assigned that determines the selection advantage . The phenotype diversification that produces the adult cell types from an unchanging genome follows the rules of development that are imposed by the regulatory interactions between the gene loci (and by interactions between the various cells in the tissue). The interactions between the genes are hard-wired in the genomic sequence and collectively form a complex network, the gene regulatory network (GRN), that orchestrates the activities of genes to produce those gene expression patterns that underlie the biologically meaningful phenotypes (Fig 1). Such a “genetic network” was first proposed by Jacob and Monod in the 1960s after they discovered that genes regulate other genes . The central idea, as can be formulated mathematically, is that in coordinating the activities of genes, the GRN tends to interlock them in distinct, self-stabilizing gene expression configurations, called attractor states (valleys in Fig 1B). A key postulate, formulated in 1969 by Stuart Kauffman, is that attractors represent the gene expression patterns that correspond to cell types (or functional cell states) . Being attractor states, such gene expression patterns are robust to perturbations; they re-establish spontaneously after disturbances, and thus can be inherited across cell generations. The existence of multiple attractor states is a feature of a particular class of complex dynamical systems to which GRNs belong . PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Download: Fig 1. The paradigm of cancer as a disease of gene regulation. (A) The current paradigm of genetic mutation as the source of phenotypic change that drives tumorigenesis. (B) The new paradigm that explains cell phenotype changes by a concerted change of gene expression: the concept of the gene regulatory network (GRN) with gene-gene interaction mediated by transcription factors (TFs) or regulatory RNAs generalized a “wiring diagram”. It governs the dynamics of gene expression profiles that intuitively (Waddington, left) or with mathematical theory (right) can be represented as a landscape. In the landscape, the attractor states of the GRN, which define stable cell phenotypes, are the valleys. The theory predicts many more attractor states than can be occupied by cells in physiological states (cell types, in gray regions). The unused attractors (red) encode the gene expression profile thought to map into those of cancer cells. Gene regulatory interactions of a given genome are implemented by transcription factors (TFs), and also by regulatory RNAs and chromosomal configurations. TF proteins and regulatory RNAs bind their targets in a sequence-specific manner. Thus, their regulatory action is highly gene locus-specific and is written in the genome; they collectively define the “wiring diagram” of the GRN (i.e., which gene regulates which genes, and how and under what conditions). The GRN was wired by evolution, e.g., via tuning of TF DNA binding motif sequences (trans-regulation) and their cognate target elements (cis-regulation). This resulted in binding specificities between regulators; such gene expression across all loci was forced into a set of genome-wide patterns, allowing the network to produce attractors (stable patterns) that encode meaningful cell phenotypes. The locus-specific TFs and regulatory RNAs are supported by the non-locus-specific apparatus of epigenetic modification (covalent marks on DNA and histone proteins) that sharpen signals and modulate temporal patterns . Thus, the GRN is a distributed information processing system of mutually regulating genes that form a web of feedback loops—contrary to early views of genetic networks as hierarchical cascades of causation that rigidly link genotype to phenotype . The GRN is not a clockwork. Stochasticity in cell-type diversification had already been proposed by Kupiec in 1983 . Thermal fluctuations of molecule concentrations (due to the small number of molecules in cells) add a layer of non-determinism to the rules of the GRN, allowing attractor states to be represented as probabilities of being occupied . This coexistence of deterministic logic and its probabilistic realization permits the definition of a potential-like quantity, which is aptly represented by Waddington’s epigenetic landscape, in which valleys correspond to attractor states and whose depth represent the relative stability of the cell phenotypes that they encode (Fig 2) . (For simplicity, but sufficient for this discussion, we deal here only with “fixed-point attractors” and omit more complex dynamical structures, such as “limit cycles”, in which cells are trapped into a closed loop trajectory, such as the cell division cycle .)

Mathematically, the epigenetic landscape can be extended to regions that represent gene activation configurations (in pink) that exist in theory but are never realized during development and in physiological tissues (green traces descending the hill in the gray regions). The unused regions (pink) contain unoccupied attractors—the cancer attractors. Under abnormal conditions cells can, upon massive perturbation of their gene expression profile, enter such cancer attractors that lack a path to the normal mature cell type attractors (bottom)—and thus are “maturation-arrested” and, if associated gene activation configurations are compatible with cell viability, can become cancerous. Mutations rewire the gene regulatory network (GRN), thus altering the dynamics, which can result in lowering of the barriers (hills) that prevent cells from leaving the physiological regions, facilitating the occupation of cancer attractors. Now, here is a crucial corollary: on the epigenetic landscape of a given GRN, there exist, for mathematical and network-evolution reasons, many more attractor states than are occupied by cells in the healthy adult organism . The phenotype of these unused attractors has been proposed to represent malignant cells ; in this view, cancer is a possibility immanent to metazoans, and hence is less suited to be seen as “being caused by something”, but rather is primarily the “unleashing of something latent”. Carcinogenesis would then be the accidental entry into these unused latently present attractors, which thus have been referred to as “cancer attractors” . And these must be avoided by normal cells in development and under physiological conditions (Fig 2). This is the reason why the old adage of the molecular biologist that development is “tightly regulated” is more profound than one may think. Waddington’s epigenetic landscape and cancer attractors In the modern interpretation of the epigenetic landscape, cancer is thus a built-in but normally not realized feature, as epitomized by the unused attractors. Since, in physiological conditions, these attractors are unoccupied, they are not exposed as phenotypes and thus, they are ’not seen’ by natural selection; most of these states would establish gene expression patterns incompatible with life in the modern metazoan tissue. Those few unused attractors that can sustain viable cells in the tissue are not fine-tuned by selection. When occupied by cells that thus, by definition, become neoplastic, cancer attractors would command phenotypes with primordial behaviors not shaped by metazoan evolution to support cell societies that maintain tissue homeostasis . In this perspective, cancer would represent atavism (“reversion to an ancestral form”): cancer cells would revive “selfish” protozoan functionalities, however imperfect . More generally speaking, unused attractors represent cell “programs” of the phylogenetic past . The accidental yet highly organized nature of vestigial phenotypes and their consistent reoccurrence is naturally explained by re-occupation of unused attractors that are an integral part of the same epigenetic landscape that is encoded by the genome and governs the unfolding of the normal extant phenotype. (The cancer atavism idea should, in its argumentation logic, not be conflated with the notion of proliferation and motility being the “default state” of cells (discussed in detail later) .) Cancer cells are also stuck in an ontogenetic past. Because unused attractors do not partake in development of later evolved mature tissues, they are more likely to produce developmentally immature, dysfunctional traits that lack fine-tuned efficient homeostasis (mathematically represented by deep, smooth basins of attraction). For instance, being ‘unevolved’, they are likely to lack the sophisticated metazoan capacities to contribute to tissue morphogenesis or to replicate genomes with absolute fidelity. Most importantly, they are not connected by developmental paths to the mature cells’ attractor states (Fig 2, right). Such paths were carved by evolution (via GRN wiring) into the epigenetic landscape to ensure that normal immature cells respond to appropriate tissue signals during development and efficiently differentiate, while being shielded from undue entry into the unevolved cancer attractors (green curved arrows in Fig 2). Once trapped in such attractors of imperfect homeostasis, cells are easily perturbed by hypoxic, inflamed and or otherwise stressed stroma , all of which are known to cause genome and epigenomic instability, resulting in genetic alterations, further promoted by the absence of optimized DNA repair systems . The immaturity of these cells places them closer to early developmental stages, in line with their expression of embryonic cell traits, such as accelerated cell division, multi-lineage potency, tolerance to genomic instability and xenobiotics—all features shared by cancer cells. Having scant access to the physiological attractors of differentiated cell state (Fig 2), cells in cancer attractors are also incapable of differentiation, hence the pathologists’ notion of maturation arrest . The ‘accidental’ entry into cancer attractors does not depend on a specific mutation; instead, all kinds on non-genetic stressors that produce particular non-physiological, unstable gene expression patterns, amplified by stochastic fluctuations of transcriptomes, can trigger exit from normal cell type attractors and entry into a nearby cancer attractor (see point 10, Table 1). Rethinking the concept of genetic causality for cancer The concept of accidental entry of cells into a latently existing but undesired attractor and then being trapped in it, supports the notion of cancer as a process of unspecific “unleashing” (of a potential) rather than of specific “de novo causation”. Cancer attractors explain the unfathomable diversity of molecular disruptions and perturbations that all can accidentally trigger the entry into them and produce, as if orchestrated by an invisible hand, a specific gene activation configuration that governs the cancerous phenotype. These disruptions can result from an immense diversity of random genetic alterations that affect proteins of a variety of functional classes or from a vast array of defects in regulatory interactions, from the rewiring of gene–gene interactions by genomic translocations (including creating novel fusion proteins or swapping promoters), the dysregulation of non-coding RNAs and RNA splicing, to altered function of broadly acting epigenetic and chromatin-modifying regulators. The immense diversity of mechanisms, all accidental, that can converge to producing the cancerous phenotype with minimal help by Darwinian selection, is perhaps the most prosaic yet profound manifestation of cancer attractors as latent structures in dark regions of the vast state space of gene activation patterns. So, if genetic alterations are involved, what is our criticism of the claim of a genetic cause of cancer in the current paradigm? Cancer cannot be explained by explicit genetic causation in the traditional sense of “a gene X for that phenotype Y” being defective, as is readily achieved for mendelian diseases. Instead, we need to consider the collective action of genes, which we now can formalize with the epigenetic landscape, as well as cell population dynamics and tissue context. The landscape provides a formalism that places the role of a genetic anomaly for tumorigenesis in a new light: genetic mutations essentially alter the GRN wiring. In mathematical models that map the wiring diagram to the landscape topography, a localized GRN change (a point mutation or a larger scale rearrangement) is a localized rewiring and will most often just gently distort the topography of the landscape. There are only so many ways a landscape can gently change its shape (while still ensuring viability)—and one typical way is by altering the barrier height that separate the attractors. Such a distortion in turn affects the cell trajectories. For instance, it could facilitate the accidental entry into a cancer attractor from a given place in the normal trajectory, driven by molecular noise or non-mutagenic environmental stress (details in ). It is in this convoluted sense that one can admit that genetic mutations can “cause” cancer. Despite the absence of developmental paths to normal mature states, the epigenetic landscape still grants cells in cancer attractors an intrinsic potential for normalization, as manifested in the rare reversion of the cancerous phenotype under particular experimental conditions . The reversion potential is rarely realized because very distinct tissue constellations are required to overcome the energy barrier to exit the cancer attractor, as seen in the particular instance of neuroblastoma that can spontaneously normalize. The difficulty of normalization is consistent with the limited success of differentiation therapy and with the exceeding rarity of “spontaneous remission” of cancer despite the theoretical reversibility of cell states . We can now more precisely articulate an indirect, convoluted role of genetic mutations in cancer to reconcile with the SMT view. Both the genetic paradigm of cancer and Neo-Darwinism rest on the tacit assumption of a 1:1 mapping between genotype and phenotype . In this view, one must, by logical necessity, explain any phenotypic change by a genetic mutation. But, as computer simulations have suggested, most mutations in the core GRN (which in principle alter the wiring of the GRN) do not qualitatively affect the topography of the epigenetic landscape (e.g., they typically do not destroy or create attractor states), but as said above, cause a gentle distortion. Thus, the majority of mutations, even those that alter gene activity, are readily buffered away. However, mild distortions due to GRN rewiring can alter the relative stabilities of attractors, and thus may affect transition rates between attractors (e.g., stem cell and differentiated state and senescent states), including rates for epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and entry to the unused attractors . Altered transition rates in turn lead to imbalances in tissue homeostasis. One manifestation is the widely observed trans-differentiation event (lineage switching, “lineage infidelity”) seen in malignancy. As to the much-needed higher-level organismal biology view of cancer as a complex disease, a first step towards organicism is in the interpretation of large-scale genomic alterations as the source of cell physiological and not genetic informational departure from the norm. Aneuploidy and polyploidy in cancer cells often result in the formation of polyploid giant cancer cells that are found in nearly half of all high-grade cancers . Polyploidy and associated expression of meiotic genes in malignant cells offer a link between cancer biology and organismal biology at a larger timescale and could represent a rather generic alternative attractor that is often accessed by tumorigenic dysregulation of the GRN. In fact, since tumors often reactivate diapause and gametogenesis programs that mark the entry into a new sexual reproduction cycle and epitomize the immortality of the germline, it has been hypothesized that cancer may recapitulate, albeit in an aberrant and abortive manner, the life cycle of organisms . Finally, beyond its putative role in generating mutations (and neoantigens) , there are also organismal consequences of genomic instability (the “mutator phenotype”), which itself is more likely a consequence of the abnormal phenotype produced by unevolved attractors than the needed source of cancer-causing mutations. Indeed, the idea of what actually “came first” was articulated by Richmond Prehn: “…it may be more correct to say that cancers beget mutations than it is to say that mutations beget cancers” . Then, we shall also remember the physical, not informational consequences of genome instability: the DNA repair response triggered by genomic instabilities produces unphysiological DNA configurations (breakpoints, stalled replication forks, RNA–DNA hybrids, double- and single-stranded DNA, etc.) that leak into the cytoplasm, which in turn, mistaken for viral invasion, activates stress and inflammatory responses via the NFkB and STING/interferon pathways, thus affecting the cell’s microenvironment . This brings us to the tissue level processes. Cancer as a tissue-based disease: The tissue organization field theory of carcinogenesis The interpretation of genome sequence-based lineage reconstruction (Table 1, point 6) defaults to the view that the tumor originates from a single cell, the “initiating” or “founder”, cancer cell. This is correct in a fundamental, almost trivial way because a group of cells always has a common ancestor—it just depends on how far back one traces the pedigree (up to the zygote). The idea of one initiating cell in which the truncal (“tumor initiating”) mutation in the clonal tree happened, making it a founder cell , ignores that its outgrowth has to depend on its neighboring cells (normal or transformed) that provide the critical tissue context for it to survive and also ignores the multiplicity of distinct cell phenotypes within an isogenic clone. Conversely, not all cells that contain that same early mutation (that would allow for later oncogenic, otherwise lethal mutations to accumulate) will become cancerous—see Table 1, points 6 and 7 . Empirical evidence contradicting the view of “cancer as a disease of the cell” was already available over 60 years ago, when David W. Smithers published an essay entitled “An Attack to Cytologism” . Smithers refuted the idea that cancer originates from an abnormal cell. His and others’ observations suggested that cancer is not a disease that starts from a single tumor-initiating cell, but rather an anomaly of tissue organization (Fig 3). (This argument only proposes that it is not as simple as postulating “a” cancer cell but does not deny the existence of individual cells with enhanced potential to drive tumor growth). PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Download: Fig 3. Cancer as a disease of the tissue, not the cell. (A) The paradigm of abnormal cells as the source of tumors. (B) The new paradigm of cancer as a disease of the tissue, explained by schematics of seminal experiments that establish the phenomenon of normalization of cancerous cells by the stroma, as well as the converse, i.e., the initiation of tumor from “healthy cells” due to carcinogenic stressors acting on the stroma. Note that this second paradigm shift implicitly requires non-genetic plasticity of cancer cells, as proposed in the first paradigm shift (Fig 1). In the traditional paradigm, plasticity is assumed only for the (non-transformed) stromal cells. A compelling Illustration of the need for a tissue-based rather than cell-centric view is the finding that while a bulk injection of hepatocarcinoma cells into the liver generates a liver tumor, injection of the same amounts of the same cell type into the spleen, which distributes transplanted cells individually throughout the liver, fails to generate a tumor . Importantly, the cells injected into the spleen became normalized in the liver by direct contact with their neighboring normal hepatic cells and were incorporated into the liver’s normal structure, underscoring the role of non-genetic, environment-regulated cell phenotype plasticity at the demarcation between normalcy and neoplasia . These observations led to the concept that there is no “cancer cell” because cells declared as such (e.g., because of canonical oncogenic mutations) behave as normal cells (Table 1, Point 2). Instead, cancer can be broadly understood as “development gone awry”. Within this perspective, the tissue organization field theory is based on two principles that unite phylogenesis and ontogenesis. Firstly, the default state of all cells is constitutive proliferation with variation and motility. Therefore, proliferation and motility do not require an explanation; instead, what ought to be explained is why cells do not proliferate and move. Secondly, cancer is a tissue-based disease, whereby the tissue organization constraints to the default state of its cells are weakened. Consequently, cells become freed to express their default state, thus proliferating, generating variation and moving. This explains tumor growth by accrual of new cells, as well as invasion and metastasis . The other major facet of carcinogenesis as a tissue-level phenomenon pertains to the role of ‘non-cancerous’ cells in the TME or the stroma. The idea that the TME, consisting of extracellular matrix (ECM), mesenchymal cells, and resident and invading immune cells, plays a role in carcinogenesis was accepted by the cancer community only in the 1990s, despite pointed reference by the pathologist Rudolph Virchow more than 150 years ago . The all too obvious role of the TME in carcinogenesis, which involves angiogenesis, inflammation, immune suppression and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) , soon led to exploding research funding in this area. However, the stromal component has mostly been seen as a necessary enabler and rarely as a driver of carcinogenesis. It provided the biological embodiment of the convenient notion of context that is often invoked to mitigate anomalies plaguing the SMT. Throughout the 20th century, carcinogenesis was considered a genetic disease of the cancer cell despite accumulating experimental evidence pointing to a causative role of the stroma . For example, the fact that injection of a chemical carcinogen administered intraperitoneally generates mammary cancers in susceptible rat strains has been attributed to mutations caused by the carcinogen in the glandular epithelial cells, such as Ha-ras-1 (details below) . However, all cells of the organism are exposed to the carcinogen. From a developmental biology perspective, the question is, which is the target of the carcinogen: the epithelium, the stroma or both? Lessons from organogenesis To understand the relationship between the stroma (the “support” scaffold of an organ) and the parenchyma (the “functional” part of the organ) in cancer, we shall review the process of organogenesis . The genesis of tissues and organs entails complex reciprocal interactions between the components of the morphogenetic field defined by a distinct 3D array of cells that gives rise to an autonomous tissue structure or organ . Numerous epithelium/mesenchyme recombination experiments have shown that it is the mesenchyme that determines the type of skin adnexa; for example, wing mesenchyme dictates the presence of chicken feathers regardless of whether it is recombined with epidermis from foot or wing, and scales appear regardless of the origin of the epidermis if recombined with mesenchyme of the foot . Similarly, the branching pattern of the epithelium of salivary and mammary glands is determined by the stroma of the organ . As in organogenesis, the stroma is equally as important in tumorigenesis. When mammary epithelial cells were exposed in vitro either to the mutagenic carcinogen N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU), or to vehicle before being transplanted into the mammary stroma of rats surgically cleared of epithelium , carcinogenesis only occurred when the stroma was exposed in vivo to NMU, regardless of whether or not the epithelial cells were exposed to the carcinogen (Fig 3). Mammary epithelial cells exposed in vitro to the carcinogen formed phenotypically normal ducts when injected into unexposed stroma. Mutations in the Ha-ras-1 gene, which was assumed to be the cause of cancerization , did not correlate with initiation of neoplasia: not only was it often found in both cleared mammary fat pads of vehicle-treated animals and intact mammary glands of untreated animals, but it was also absent in various carcinomas. Such tissue recombination experiments show that the stroma is a crucial target of the carcinogen, while the epithelium is not, and that in this case, mutation in the Ha-ras-1 gene is neither necessary nor sufficient for neoplastic development . A comparable experiment showed that radiation-induced changes in mammary gland stroma contributed to the neoplastic progression of non-irradiated, quasi-normal (TP53-mutated but non-tumorigenic) mammary epithelial cells . Finally, nontumorigenic human prostatic epithelial cells from benign prostate hyperplasia develops into tumors when recombined with prostate cancer stroma and not with normal stroma . Recent stromal-epithelial tissue recombinant culture systems and single-cell transcriptomics have begun to unravel the molecular signals that mediate such stromal tumorigenic effects . Not only can carcinogenesis be initiated by injuring the stroma, but a normal stroma can also act as a gate-keeper of neoplastic development by constraining cells belonging to a neoplasm to behave as the normal cells of the organ that form normal tissue structures . The experimental normalization of mutated cells that were once part of a tumor has been reported for a variety of cancer types, among them melanoma (by the neural crest ), hepatocarcinoma (by normal liver ), or mammary cancer (by normal mammary gland ). A compelling demonstration of a tumor-restraining role of stroma is the case of localized pancreatic cancer, where targeting of (originally considered tumor-promoting) CAFs resulted in tumor progression and invasion . Intriguingly, the same chemically inert material can cause tumors in animals when implanted as rods but not when injected as powder of the same material and same mass . This suggests that chronic wounding and/or mechanical stress of the tissue causes carcinogenesis through breakdown of physical tissue architecture in the absence of genotoxicity, something that has long been observed in multiple cancer models, underscoring the importance of tissue fields . In the light of the central role of the mesenchyme on the determination of the parenchyma phenotype, it is unsurprising to see the surge of data showing a tumor-promoting effect of altered stroma, most notably, ECM composition, fibroblast phenotype (in the form of CAFs) and tumor-promoting chronic inflammation . While these findings have triggered a massive quest for underlying chemical mediators, one should not forget that tissue organization plays not just a supporting, but a determinant role. The organicist perspective is based on the interdependency of the organism and its organs. It recognizes a circular causal regimen by closure of constraints that makes parts interdependent , wherein these constraints are not only molecules, but also biophysical force . Since such a view encompasses tissues not simply as collectives of cells but as emergent anatomical and functional organized entities, it affords little opportunity for discrete molecular targeting, limiting its appeal to reductionist research programs in search of a molecular ‘silver bullet’. Explaining anomalies in cancer biology under the SMT paradigm A common way of explaining the lack of fit between the SMT and data has been to invoke involvement of biological processes not obviously related to oncogenic mutations, such as cellular metabolism, stromal alterations, bacterial and viral carcinogenesis, immune surveillance, etc. that we have characterized as “compromises”. In such hybridization of explanations, old ideas are kept intact, such as the claim that cancer is a disease of the cell and that a normal cell is rendered cancerous by genetic alterations. Justifications often include epimutations due to altered epigenetic marks (epigenetic reprogramming) or references to the old dualism between initiator (mutagenic) and promoter (non-mutagenic) . The concept of dividing the cause of cancer into the initiator, which is the mutagenic event, and the promoter, a chronic (chemical) stress by typically non-genotoxic agents, has been proposed based on the classical experiments of skin carcinogenesis, first performed a century ago. Mice subjected to chemicals known to be mutagenic will develop skin cancer only after ensuing repeated treatment with a non-genotoxic irritant, such as croton oil or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetra-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) . Recent genomic sequence analyses reveal that the initial carcinogen indeed caused genetic alterations, which remain silent until application of TPA at a later time point. After TPA treatment, development of papillomas and carcinomas was observed . The elegance of the concept in its modern reincarnation is that the promoter is now understood to not only exert its effect on the mutated cells via non-genetic phenotype switching, but also on the TME via tumorigenic inflammation. The initiator-promoter model is often used to explain the well-known fact that a large fraction of listed carcinogens is non-mutagenic; they may apparently cause cancer by triggering outgrowth of occult mutated cancerous cells. However, this picture is still too simplistic, exemplifying the aforementioned hybridization of old ideas with new findings. At its core, it still maintains a primary causative role of genetic mutations in a single cancer initiating cell, followed by a sequence of causal steps. The qualitative dichotomy between a mutagenic initiator that creates ’cancer cells’ and the non-genetic, tissue-perturbing promoter that expands them may not be as clear-cut. Indeed, the reverse experiment (first treatment with the promoter followed by the initiator) equally produces tumors . This result refutes the classical model that requires that the mutagenic (alleged) initiator must act first. Instead, the reverse experiment suggests merely a synergism between initiator and promoter, albeit a complex one that must involve tissue memory of non-mutagenic perturbations. The promoter/initiator framework by itself is an interesting model, but further investigation should be conducted through the lens of non-genetic dynamics, tissue organization (including the TME) and organismal biology. Another aspect that has been invoked to alleviate the discrepancies between genome sequencing results and the SMT is epigenetic reprogramming . A solid, formal explanation for enduring changes in the landscape of cell phenotype would have to consider the dynamics of GRNs because epigenetic marks themselves are not explanatory; they are reversible, and the epigenetic modifiers that place these marks are not locus-specific and must be guided by the GRN to coordinate gene loci activities to produce coherent expression patterns that can be locked-in (attractors) . Moreover, the attractor stability of a cell phenotype can be disrupted by drastic changes in its microenvironment that affect a large number of regulatory genes to overcome attractor dynamics. This property is evident in the recombination studies with fetal mesenchyme, underscoring the strong leverage that tissue level interactions and tissue architecture possess in perturbing the GRN at multiple points to trigger attractor destabilization and transitions . Interestingly, the hybridization of concepts to accommodate anomalies is also present in the extended list of the ‘Hallmarks of cancer’. Indeed, hallmarks only serve as attachment points for tenuous molecular causes, dictated by Dennett’s “greedy” reductionism, namely the recourse by scientists to “underestimate the complexities, trying to skip whole layers or levels of theory in their rush to fasten everything securely and neatly to the foundation” . This attitude became evident in the latest installment of the “Hallmarks of cancer” listing that, instead of biological thinking, uses the existence of mutated genetic pathways to motivate new hallmarks that by necessity are explained by them. Notwithstanding, the two new hallmarks, “Unlocking phenotypic plasticity” and “Non-mutational epigenetic programming”, are non-genetic, with ironic redundancy between them . Conclusions and outlook Dealing with a complex world, philosophers of science talk about auxiliary hypotheses, which are readily erected using known facts. These abound because complex systems contain a web of causal interactions, as epitomized by the living organism. They offer an uncountable set of auxiliary explanations that can rescue any existing paradigm and not only renders the falsification of a hypothesis meaningless but also its defense by excuse arguments. Put differently, the genetic paradigm of cancer is a vague theory and, as the physicist Richard Feynman stated, vague theories cannot be disproven , which is even more true for as complex a processes as carcinogenesis. Therefore, interpretation of empirical results guided by formal theory based on some set of first principles, and undaunted by dogmas, is ever more important in an era of easy data acquisition. Over the years, many proposals outside the paradigm of cancer as a genetic disease have been offered in view of the accumulating findings pointing to shortcomings of the SMT. Some scientists in the SMT camp—still a minority—now begin to embrace a pluralistic view. For instance, we must recall Mike Stratton’s quote in the opening section of this Essay. After his team failed to find mutational signatures specific to endemic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, he concluded: “We have found evidence that chemicals might be able to work in different ways other than directly causing mutations to increase a person’s chances of developing cancer. We will have to rethink our ideas about the way in which some cancers develop. It is a crucial lesson” . We hope that such “crucial lessons” will not be ignored. Pursuing a rigorous explanation of carcinogenesis entails identification of fundamental biological principles placed within a consistent formal theoretical framework, instead of more terminological acrobatics centered around observed altered molecular pathways. As Darwin pointed out to a friend in 1821, if one were “only to observe, not theorise… might as well go into a gravel-pit and count the pebbles and describe their colours. How odd it is that everyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view, if it is to be of any service” . Theories do not need to be right; they are a practical tool to conduct research. If Darwin’s pebbles are today’s molecular alterations in tumors, then we must not simply be satisfied with their categorization in a system of ingredients that cause tumors, as illustrated by the proposed hallmarks. We must rather regard the hallmarks merely as manifestations of fundamental principles of living organisms. An epistemic shift towards a biological theory of cancer may still be an uphill battle in the current climate of thought created by the ease of data collection and a culture of research that discourages ’disruptive science’ . Here, we have made an argument for dropping the SMT and its epicycles. We presented new and old but sidelined theoretical alternatives to the SMT that embrace theory and organismal biology and can guide experiments and data interpretation. We expect that the diminishing returns from the ceaselessly growing databases of somatic mutations, the equivalent to Darwin’s gravel pit, may soon reach a pivot point. In addition, we hope that then the adherents of the genetic paradigm of cancer will begin to expand their vista on cancer in a profound way.

JP Morgan,The silence of opioids-dependent chronic pain patients: A text mining analysis from sex and gender perspective,"Abstract Existing evidence indicates sex-related differences in Prescription Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) in Chronic Non-Cancer Pain (CNCP). However to date, there is scant evidence for other socioeconomic factors in these differences. Our aim was to enquire about the influence of gender and drug copayment of OUD narratives by the text mining analysis. A prospective mixed-methods study was designed and performed at Pain Unit (PU) including 238 real world patients with CNCP divided in controls (n = 206) and OUD cases (n = 32) due to DSM-5 diagnosis Variables related to pain, sleep, mental and health status were collected in together with sex and gender interaction, in pain status, along 30-45 min face-to-face interviews. Sex differences were observed due to women’s significantly older ages, with a stronger impact on mental health, and an even stronger one for the OUD women. Globally, OUD cases were more unemployed vs the CNCP controls, and on a significantly higher median opioid daily dose of 90 [100] mg/day. Although OUD participants did more social activities, they tended to use less vocabulary to express themselves regardless of their sex, gender role or economic status. In contrast, the CNCP participants presented more differences driven by their incomes, with “limited” being the most discriminating word for those on low income, followed by “less” and “help”. Here, the most significant word of CNCP women was “husband”, followed by “tasks”. In contrast, gender reproductive roles shared similarities in both sexes, being one of the most discriminatory words “help”. The data show that OUD patients seem to have a marked influence of OUD on poorer lexicon and simpler narrative, together with a significant impact of socioeconomic factors on the CNCP narratives. The conclusion suggests to extend the research to better understand the effect of sex, gender and socioeconomic status in CNCP especially on OUD women’s health.

Introduction The drug addiction stigma is a significant barrier in Chronic Non-Cancer Pain (CNCP) management [1,2]. There are well-established risk factors for opioid use disorder (OUD), such as younger age, history of substance dependence and/or mental illness, and higher opioid doses [3,4]. Although sex and gender differences in CNCP have been previously investigated in this context [5], the literature contains very few studies with clinical translation in OUD management. Understanding attitudes towards the individuals who use opioids is a crucial matter to tackle negative perceptions of opioid use during medical visits improving adherence and tolerability [6]. Data have revealed different substance use patterns, health and social functioning between men and women [7]. Recent studies suggest sex-related differences because women are more likely to undergo inadequate pain management [8], together with more difficulty with accessing pain care [9]. These sex-related differences highlight areas for improved intervention, especially when OUD is detected [10]. This potential sex and gender influence could be used to develop an integrative treatment regimen according to individual needs in relation, i.e., to gender roles. In principle, the term “sex” refers to biological differences between men and women, specifically reproductive organs and their functions, while the term “gender” refers to the social context in which people live and which contributes to a subjective sexual identity, masculine or feminine. It is based on cultural norms and specific to a historical era and, therefore, is constantly changing, influencing everyday actions, societal expectations and experiences [11]. These are the behaviors that men and women exhibit in private and public realms. Globally, they are socio-cultural expectations that apply to individuals according to their assignment to a sex category [12]. In this study, productive (e.g., paid- workers) or reproductive roles (e.g., childcare and parenting assistance or relationship) gender roles were considered to enhance understanding of the identification for this challenging and growing population [13]. Moreover, sex-related differences and gender roles are intersected by other social determinants, including income, education, or occupation. All are critical factors that contribute to ongoing health disparities between sexes [14] in pain management [15]. As part of health systems research, a gender analysis seeks to understand how gender power relations create inequities in access to resources, the distribution of labor and roles, social norms and values, and decision making [16]. In fact, women have traditionally experienced heightened vulnerability to the adverse medical and social consequences of opioid dependence as a result of biological sex-related characteristics and socially defined gender roles’ [17]. Nowadays, the innovative text mining analysis, which combines data mining, linguistics and computer science [18], has proven to be a useful tool to extract information from unstructured data, involving the detection of knowledge from textual data. It is used worldwide in many settings. In healthcare, it has been used to identify adverse drug events, help physicians make diagnoses, and informed treatment decisions [19–22]. This could allow us to obtain qualitative information from unstructured texts as individuals’ interviews. This could help us to understand how sex and gender influence patients’ narratives about their CNCP experiences [23], which are often crucial to gain access to opioid prescriptions [24], and thus a potential higher risk to OUD. For this reason, our main goal was to use text mining to: study the influence of sex, gender and drug copayment in OUD narratives by the text mining analysis. 1) Evaluate if sex and gender differences could be found between CNCP patients’ narratives. 2) Evaluate if sex and gender differences could be found between OUD patients’ narratives and control subjects. 3) Figure out whether these differences could be associated with other socioeconomic variables, such as drug copayment.

Materials and methods Study design and participants A prospective mixed-methods study was designed and performed at the Pain Unit (PU) of the Alicante Health Department–Dr. Balmis General University Hospital in Spain. The recruitment period for this study was from October 1st 2021 to September 30th 2023 and it included 238 patients with CNCP (71% women; 13% cases with OUD) to provide quantitative and qualitative information. The inclusion criteria were adults (≥18 years) with CNCP who required opioid analgesic treatment and signed informed consent. The subset of patients with overlap of CNCP and OUD were evaluated with a specific questionnaire to assess pain. Moreover, we also have available different tools to explore pain. In the case of OUD, these patients are first evaluated in our unit with the DSM-5 [25]. Positive cases for OUD were classified and referred to a consult with a multidisciplinary team composed of a specialized doctor, a pharmacologist, a psychologist and a primary care doctor. The patients with oncologic pain or any psychiatric disorder (depression and anxiety) that could interfere with properly performing this study were excluded. Other chronic pain syndromes of unclear pathophysiology, such as fibromyalgia or neuropathic pain, such as painful polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and post-stroke pain, were not included because opioids are not recommended for some of these conditions [26]. Ethics statement This study was approved by the Ethics Committee Board of the Dr. Balmis General University Hospital of Alicante (code SESGEN text mining: PI2023-021). All subjects gave verbal and signed informed consent before participating in interviews. Confidentiality of all the information was guaranteed. The study was done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki regarding research involving human subjects. Procedure and data collection A consecutive sampling method was used, including all patients who attended consultations during the data collection period according to their scheduled medical appointments. The researchers and interviewers reviewed the schedule of the PU-appointed patients one day a week (usually Thursdays) and prepared the questionnaires and informed consents. When patients met the inclusion criteria, they were informed by the PU healthcare team about the purpose of the study. Then, any interested individuals were asked by the research staff to sign an informed consent. All variables were collected, including an OUD diagnosis following the DSM-5 criteria [25]. If necessary, the participants’ clinical data were completed using electronic health records (EHRs), which allows medical diagnoses, outcomes and medication use to be reviewed. Clinical variables. Several demographic characteristics, such as age, sex (women, men, non-binary people), employment (working, retired, work disability, unemployed or homemaker) were firstly registered (S1 Table). A Global Pain State questionnaire was used to evaluate pain intensity and relief during the interviews. Pain intensity and pain relief were measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) [27]. Both consist of a horizontal line ranging from 0 (lowest) to 100 mm (highest), where patients point out their pain intensity or pain relief on the line. The EuroQol-5D-3L scale was used to evaluate quality of life. It consists of a VAS (vertical line from 0 the worst imaginable health status to 100 mm the best imaginable one) where patients indicate their current health status. Health utility status was calculated (0 death to 1 perfect health) based on five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) with five severity levels on each dimension (none, mild, moderate, severe, and unbearable to perform or extreme problems; 53112 reg. number available at https://euroqol.org/) [27]. The Short Format Health Survey 12 (SF12) was used to measure health status. It consists of a 12-item questionnaire with a mental health (MCS, 0-100 scores) and a physical health score (PCS, 24-57 scores 0-100 scores) with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the general US population [28]. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 0-21 scores) was used to measure psychological health. Scores were classified as negative (normal range, < 7), doubt (suggestive of mood disorder, 8 - 10) and case (probable presence of mood disorder, > 11) [29]. The 30-item validated “Impairment and Functioning Inventory” (IDF-R) related scale was used to measure pain interference in four life areas: Household Activities (11 items), Independent Function (7 items), Leisure Activities (4 items), and Social Activities (5 items). Additionally, there were two final scores, such as: Functionality level (0-108, from 0 times to activity done, i.e., “Have you driven a car?” to more than 10 times last week) and Impairment level (0-27, from 0 (no impairment) to 1 (yes)) (S2 Table) [30]. The Sleep Scale from the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS-SS) was used to measure sleep quality. It consists of a 9-item questionnaire that is self-administered and takes 2–3 minutes to complete. The sum of the scores of the items and domains becomes a numerical scale of 0–100 in all the items. Two exceptions are contemplated: the score of the item “quantity” ranges between 0–24 and the score of the item “adequacy of sleep” ranges between 0–1. Higher scores indicate worse sleep problems [31]. Pharmacology and use of hospital resources. The use (yes/no) of simple analgesics (i.e., paracetamol and metamizole), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids (i.e., tramadol, codeine, fentanyl, oxycodone, tapentadol, buprenorphine, morphine, hydromorphone, methadone), along with immediate release opioids, were recorded. In different opioid combinations, the oral morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD, mg/day) was estimated with available references [32]. In Spain, medical care (primary, specialized and hospital care) are completely free and universal. However, pharmaceutical copayment is the patient’s contribution to pharmaceutical services after Spanish Royal Decree Law 16/2012 came into force. This decree states that workers have to pay 40%, those with HIV and chronically ill patients pay 10%, and pensioners, disabled individuals and those with work-related illnesses are exempt. A 40% of copayment is fixed for annual incomes up to 18,000 euro. This percentage was fixed to classify low (>40%) or high copayment [33]. Quantitative and qualitative gender information. Three trained interviewers conducted face-to-face interviews that lasted 30-45 minutes being blinded to the patient’s OUD status. The interviewers divided the weeks supporting the clinical consultation, in a variable way. The evaluator conducted the process as an interview, asking each question aloud and recording each participant’s responses verbatim. This approach allowed for the capture of the subjects’ exact verbal expressions, facilitating a detailed textual analysis of individual responses. All the patients were self-reported as cis (“female” or “male”: the sample included no non-binary person) and a consecutive number was assigned. Quantitative information about gender roles assessed or gender identity was obtained by 15 questions. These questions were based on sex and gender roles studies [34]. Here questions 2-6 were related to gender identity (female/male), while gender roles were related to questions 7 (work), 9 (domestic responsibilities), 11-12 (partner relationships) and 13 (family) (S1 Questionnaire) [34]. Self-reported gender roles were reproductive role (childbearing and caring for children), unpaid domestic tasks to maintain homes (cooking, fetching water, cleaning, washing clothes and similar) and productive role, which is work done to produce goods and services for consumption or trade (S3 Table) [35]. These gender roles are, respectively, associated in society with men and women in a stereotypical manner [36]. The percentage of affirmative answers to each question was compared between sexes. Finally, a group of testimonials selected from the different questions, and clearly associated with gender conflict, were separately analyzed. Some of the speeches of participants’ testimonials were selected to illustrate differences. Authors did the first interviews’ statements’ translation from Spanish to English by pairs. The final check testimonials (Spanish and English translation) from the database were then checked by a native English speaker. Text mining analysis Text mining is a variation in the field called data mining, which attempts to find interesting patterns from large databases. The objective is to discover unknown high-quality information from a text. The first step of this technique is to specifically obtain a textual document to process it, and to check its formatting and characters [37]. In this study the followed steps were to: 1. remove redundancies by ignoring cases; 2. delete punctuation marks; 3. remove digits at the end and delete commonly used stop words in a language that do not provide any information in the text analysis. Some examples in English are: that, then, the, a, an, and, among others. Next the processed document goes to the textual analysis phase to discover any important knowledge to be processed. Figures represent the most frequently used words (triangle) by the OUD diagnosed patients due DSM-5 criteria (yes/no) to describe their CNCP experience, due to sex, gender role or drug copayment. Statistical data analysis A descriptive analysis of the continuous quantitative variables is presented as the mean and standard deviation (M ± SD). The discrete variables are shown using their median and interquartile range (Med [IQR]). Categorical data is expressed as percentages (%). A correspondence analysis (CA) is used to describe any potential relations between variables [38]. This involves the normalization of the cross-table of frequencies so that cross-table entries can be represented in terms of the distance between dimensions in a low-dimensional space. The CA represents the rows and columns of a data matrix as points in a spatial representation called a map or a biplot [39,40]. The positions of points suggest facilitated interpretations of data content [41]. Each word is represented by a triangle, and its size indicates the frequency of the word and the distance to the closest one denotes the similarity between them [42]. The distance between words and the origin coordinates (0, 0) measures the quality and contribution to the representation. Therefore, the words that lie further from the origin are more discriminatory and well-represented in the biplot [43]. Proximity between terms (groups) indicates similarity (clusters).

Discussion The text mining analysis showed that the OUD chronic pain patients used a simpler lexicon with words that did not provide clear information about how they described their pain, and with no sex, gender or economic status significant differences. In contrast, the no-OUD CNCP subjects used richer vocabulary and terms to describe functional limitations caused by pain, especially for the low copayment percentage patients with the words “less” and “help”, and also with sex and gender clear differences. Speeches also suggested that the CNCP patients with a self-reported reproductive gender role used the same lexicon between men and women, which had a stronger impact of gender role than sex. Here men tended to play more productive roles than women and to focus on “work” and economical situations. In contrast, reproductive roles stressed the words “husband”, “anything” and “help”, but with no sex differences. Understanding and addressing social health determinants between genders is an essential first step towards achieving an appropriate pain management. Results indicate the need for health professionals to act more intentionally by applying an intersectional lens when identifying priorities in OUD pain management [44,45]. Probably the scarce OUD sample avoids finding a relevant sex and gender impact in narratives. In this sense, other authors have observed how OUD men exhibit significantly lower distress tolerance levels than OUD women and men with no history of opioid dependence [46]. Thus, the OUD’s poor lexicon in our study should be more profoundly analysed to understand the social base of sex- differences observed in OUD studies in our region [47]. Moreover, according to our results, a stronger impact on mental health was observed for women in both groups, together with a significant difference in age and employment status. This highlights the need for further research into the role of biological sex in opioid use to prevent potential health inequities in OUD prevalence and management [41]. Its future implementation in clinical guides to prevent OUD in long-term opioid users is essential, especially for primary care providers who are at the forefront of the efforts for its prevention during routine screening of CNCP patients [48]. Literature findings suggest that women are more likely to be prescribed opioids for non-medical use, and they often present higher emotional and affective distress compared to men [49]. Our chronic pain women had experienced a sense of a lack of understanding by others when explaining their inability to continue with their work and home responsibilities [50,51]. This is relevant because, although household tasks may have changed in past decades, significant gender pain inequalities still exist [52]. Our female sample were still responsible for domestic work, working double and triple shifts, and received very little support in care tasks, which have been associated with poorer health [53]. About being a homemaker, our study evidenced that OUD patients were associated with higher unemployment rates and women were the only homemakers. In fact 34% of the included subjects mentioned reproductive roles, which shared similarities with women’s statements, and the most discriminatory words were “husband”, “anything” and “help”. In contrast, previous data evidenced that unemployment status was considered a relevant indicator of pain-related disability in men [54]. In resume, results suggests that these women might be exposed to a heavier family burden, which would stress the female lifetime, and their heavier working domestic and occupational burdens, which may imply a higher risk of developing painful disease [51] being a source of pain stereotypes and potential opioid use biases [55]. Advancing pain research requires clear and transparent reporting on sex/gender inequities, including younger CNCP patients (under 45-50 years old) in our samples to compare our data to, and working towards greater gender equality at home to improve women’s health and well-being [53,56]. All this information could help clinicians to better respond to the psychological health needs of women in the CNCP population in OUD deprescription procedures [41,57]. Of course, the social context and determinants are also relevant features of social learning approaches, which used to be applied, separately, to gender role development and pain being paid far less analysis than clinical characteristics [58,59]. In this sense, the text mining analysis has been a great help to understand this intersectional perspective with drug-copayment in OUD narratives. Previous data revealed that people with low socioeconomic status are at higher risk of developing long-term opioid use [60] In our region, different socio-economic statuses between the no-OUD subjects were intersected by sex [61] The fact that 91% of our population has monthly incomes below 1,000 euros, which corresponds to the minimum wage in Spain, limited our analysis in OUD subjects. It is important to note that the OUD group was smaller than the controls due to the low prevalence of dependent cases in PU in the real world. Anyhow, more knowledge of the socio-economic risk factors for long-term pain is necessary to facilitate effective communication during pain treatment [24,54]. In this sense, we propose three research areas that should be prioritized for an equal pain care: (1) Improve the understanding of gender differences in CNCP management even more due to the stronger impact on women’s mental health; (2) Consider socioeconomic status in opioid long use for chronic pain, and work towards a greater gender equality in reproductive roles as non-paid work; (3) Conduct sex and gender-stratified clinical trials with a representative sample of women and men.

Limitations There are some limitations in this study that need to be acknowledged. Firstly, the sample size was limited by a “convenience sample” with similar demographics (white, middle-aged) who came from a single hospital and were predominantly women. Consequently, the results of this study may not represent a broader population’s experience. In addition, the OUD patients provided very few narratives to explain their pain experience, which limits the extent of the qualitative analysis between patient groups. Secondly, the employed gender questionnaire is a new scale that has to be validated in other heterogeneous populations to assess its utility. Thirdly, given our sample’s relatively older mean age, the number of patients who actively worked was very small, and sex differences were difficult to compare together with the discussion of gender roles. As there are not enough younger (under 45 or under 50) people to compare to, this would be worth studying in the future. Furthermore, the financial situation can be a variable that might change along the patients’ lifespan, which was not considered in the present study. Finally, there are other important factors that were not controlled for in this study, such as pain duration, family/social support, or non-binary subjects. As patients could be classified with both gender roles, very few testimonials were available for the text mining analysis for those who played only one of the roles. Surprisingly, OUD’s quality of life and socialisation were better than for no-OUD despite their simpler lexicon. All this should be considered in future analyses as well as performing more complex text mining analysis [62–64]. Given the differences shown, we will continue to work with Natural Language Processing, and analysis of the emotional impact of content. All of these would help to understand this OUD. complex population that used to come with lived childhood experiences, a variety of very different pain diagnoses, as well as a vast range of mental health diagnoses and psychosocial histories. Opioids, known for their potent pain-relieving characteristics, are essential in pain management, but they come with substantial drawbacks such as dependence. Our findings show a strong influence of OUD on narratives, together with a significant impact of sex, gender roles and economic status on CNCP. Moreover, pain-related gender stereotypes may still limit early and equal pain care access for women with a stronger impact on their mental health. These data highlight the need for an interdisciplinary patient management with CNCP even more when an OUD has been diagnosed.

However to date, there is scant evidence for other socioeconomic factors in these differences. Our aim was to enquire about the influence of gender and drug copayment of OUD narratives by the text mining analysis. A prospective mixed-methods study was designed and performed at Pain Unit (PU) including 238 real world patients with CNCP divided in controls (n = 206) and OUD cases (n = 32) due to DSM-5 diagnosis Variables related to pain, sleep, mental and health status were collected in together with sex and gender interaction, in pain status, along 30-45 min face-to-face interviews. Sex differences were observed due to women’s significantly older ages, with a stronger impact on mental health, and an even stronger one for the OUD women. Globally, OUD cases were more unemployed vs the CNCP controls, and on a significantly higher median opioid daily dose of 90 mg/day. Although OUD participants did more social activities, they tended to use less vocabulary to express themselves regardless of their sex, gender role or economic status. In contrast, the CNCP participants presented more differences driven by their incomes, with “limited” being the most discriminating word for those on low income, followed by “less” and “help”. Here, the most significant word of CNCP women was “husband”, followed by “tasks”. In contrast, gender reproductive roles shared similarities in both sexes, being one of the most discriminatory words “help”. The data show that OUD patients seem to have a marked influence of OUD on poorer lexicon and simpler narrative, together with a significant impact of socioeconomic factors on the CNCP narratives. The conclusion suggests to extend the research to better understand the effect of sex, gender and socioeconomic status in CNCP especially on OUD women’s health.

There are well-established risk factors for opioid use disorder (OUD), such as younger age, history of substance dependence and/or mental illness, and higher opioid doses . Although sex and gender differences in CNCP have been previously investigated in this context , the literature contains very few studies with clinical translation in OUD management. Understanding attitudes towards the individuals who use opioids is a crucial matter to tackle negative perceptions of opioid use during medical visits improving adherence and tolerability . Data have revealed different substance use patterns, health and social functioning between men and women . Recent studies suggest sex-related differences because women are more likely to undergo inadequate pain management , together with more difficulty with accessing pain care . These sex-related differences highlight areas for improved intervention, especially when OUD is detected . This potential sex and gender influence could be used to develop an integrative treatment regimen according to individual needs in relation, i.e., to gender roles. In principle, the term “sex” refers to biological differences between men and women, specifically reproductive organs and their functions, while the term “gender” refers to the social context in which people live and which contributes to a subjective sexual identity, masculine or feminine. It is based on cultural norms and specific to a historical era and, therefore, is constantly changing, influencing everyday actions, societal expectations and experiences . These are the behaviors that men and women exhibit in private and public realms. Globally, they are socio-cultural expectations that apply to individuals according to their assignment to a sex category . In this study, productive (e.g., paid- workers) or reproductive roles (e.g., childcare and parenting assistance or relationship) gender roles were considered to enhance understanding of the identification for this challenging and growing population . Moreover, sex-related differences and gender roles are intersected by other social determinants, including income, education, or occupation. All are critical factors that contribute to ongoing health disparities between sexes in pain management . As part of health systems research, a gender analysis seeks to understand how gender power relations create inequities in access to resources, the distribution of labor and roles, social norms and values, and decision making . In fact, women have traditionally experienced heightened vulnerability to the adverse medical and social consequences of opioid dependence as a result of biological sex-related characteristics and socially defined gender roles’ . Nowadays, the innovative text mining analysis, which combines data mining, linguistics and computer science , has proven to be a useful tool to extract information from unstructured data, involving the detection of knowledge from textual data. It is used worldwide in many settings. In healthcare, it has been used to identify adverse drug events, help physicians make diagnoses, and informed treatment decisions . This could allow us to obtain qualitative information from unstructured texts as individuals’ interviews. This could help us to understand how sex and gender influence patients’ narratives about their CNCP experiences , which are often crucial to gain access to opioid prescriptions , and thus a potential higher risk to OUD. For this reason, our main goal was to use text mining to: study the influence of sex, gender and drug copayment in OUD narratives by the text mining analysis. 1) Evaluate if sex and gender differences could be found between CNCP patients’ narratives. 2) Evaluate if sex and gender differences could be found between OUD patients’ narratives and control subjects. 3) Figure out whether these differences could be associated with other socioeconomic variables, such as drug copayment.

Some examples in English are: that, then, the, a, an, and, among others. Next the processed document goes to the textual analysis phase to discover any important knowledge to be processed. Figures represent the most frequently used words (triangle) by the OUD diagnosed patients due DSM-5 criteria (yes/no) to describe their CNCP experience, due to sex, gender role or drug copayment. Statistical data analysis A descriptive analysis of the continuous quantitative variables is presented as the mean and standard deviation (M ± SD). The discrete variables are shown using their median and interquartile range (Med ). Categorical data is expressed as percentages (%). A correspondence analysis (CA) is used to describe any potential relations between variables . This involves the normalization of the cross-table of frequencies so that cross-table entries can be represented in terms of the distance between dimensions in a low-dimensional space. The CA represents the rows and columns of a data matrix as points in a spatial representation called a map or a biplot . The positions of points suggest facilitated interpretations of data content . Each word is represented by a triangle, and its size indicates the frequency of the word and the distance to the closest one denotes the similarity between them . The distance between words and the origin coordinates (0, 0) measures the quality and contribution to the representation. Therefore, the words that lie further from the origin are more discriminatory and well-represented in the biplot . Proximity between terms (groups) indicates similarity (clusters). Discussion The text mining analysis showed that the OUD chronic pain patients used a simpler lexicon with words that did not provide clear information about how they described their pain, and with no sex, gender or economic status significant differences. In contrast, the no-OUD CNCP subjects used richer vocabulary and terms to describe functional limitations caused by pain, especially for the low copayment percentage patients with the words “less” and “help”, and also with sex and gender clear differences. Speeches also suggested that the CNCP patients with a self-reported reproductive gender role used the same lexicon between men and women, which had a stronger impact of gender role than sex. Here men tended to play more productive roles than women and to focus on “work” and economical situations. In contrast, reproductive roles stressed the words “husband”, “anything” and “help”, but with no sex differences. Understanding and addressing social health determinants between genders is an essential first step towards achieving an appropriate pain management. Results indicate the need for health professionals to act more intentionally by applying an intersectional lens when identifying priorities in OUD pain management . Probably the scarce OUD sample avoids finding a relevant sex and gender impact in narratives. In this sense, other authors have observed how OUD men exhibit significantly lower distress tolerance levels than OUD women and men with no history of opioid dependence . Thus, the OUD’s poor lexicon in our study should be more profoundly analysed to understand the social base of sex- differences observed in OUD studies in our region . Moreover, according to our results, a stronger impact on mental health was observed for women in both groups, together with a significant difference in age and employment status. This highlights the need for further research into the role of biological sex in opioid use to prevent potential health inequities in OUD prevalence and management . Its future implementation in clinical guides to prevent OUD in long-term opioid users is essential, especially for primary care providers who are at the forefront of the efforts for its prevention during routine screening of CNCP patients . Literature findings suggest that women are more likely to be prescribed opioids for non-medical use, and they often present higher emotional and affective distress compared to men . Our chronic pain women had experienced a sense of a lack of understanding by others when explaining their inability to continue with their work and home responsibilities . This is relevant because, although household tasks may have changed in past decades, significant gender pain inequalities still exist . Our female sample were still responsible for domestic work, working double and triple shifts, and received very little support in care tasks, which have been associated with poorer health . About being a homemaker, our study evidenced that OUD patients were associated with higher unemployment rates and women were the only homemakers. In fact 34% of the included subjects mentioned reproductive roles, which shared similarities with women’s statements, and the most discriminatory words were “husband”, “anything” and “help”. In contrast, previous data evidenced that unemployment status was considered a relevant indicator of pain-related disability in men . In resume, results suggests that these women might be exposed to a heavier family burden, which would stress the female lifetime, and their heavier working domestic and occupational burdens, which may imply a higher risk of developing painful disease being a source of pain stereotypes and potential opioid use biases . Advancing pain research requires clear and transparent reporting on sex/gender inequities, including younger CNCP patients (under 45-50 years old) in our samples to compare our data to, and working towards greater gender equality at home to improve women’s health and well-being . All this information could help clinicians to better respond to the psychological health needs of women in the CNCP population in OUD deprescription procedures . Of course, the social context and determinants are also relevant features of social learning approaches, which used to be applied, separately, to gender role development and pain being paid far less analysis than clinical characteristics . In this sense, the text mining analysis has been a great help to understand this intersectional perspective with drug-copayment in OUD narratives. Previous data revealed that people with low socioeconomic status are at higher risk of developing long-term opioid use In our region, different socio-economic statuses between the no-OUD subjects were intersected by sex The fact that 91% of our population has monthly incomes below 1,000 euros, which corresponds to the minimum wage in Spain, limited our analysis in OUD subjects. It is important to note that the OUD group was smaller than the controls due to the low prevalence of dependent cases in PU in the real world. Anyhow, more knowledge of the socio-economic risk factors for long-term pain is necessary to facilitate effective communication during pain treatment . In this sense, we propose three research areas that should be prioritized for an equal pain care: (1) Improve the understanding of gender differences in CNCP management even more due to the stronger impact on women’s mental health; (2) Consider socioeconomic status in opioid long use for chronic pain, and work towards a greater gender equality in reproductive roles as non-paid work; (3) Conduct sex and gender-stratified clinical trials with a representative sample of women and men. Limitations There are some limitations in this study that need to be acknowledged. Firstly, the sample size was limited by a “convenience sample” with similar demographics (white, middle-aged) who came from a single hospital and were predominantly women. Consequently, the results of this study may not represent a broader population’s experience. In addition, the OUD patients provided very few narratives to explain their pain experience, which limits the extent of the qualitative analysis between patient groups. Secondly, the employed gender questionnaire is a new scale that has to be validated in other heterogeneous populations to assess its utility. Thirdly, given our sample’s relatively older mean age, the number of patients who actively worked was very small, and sex differences were difficult to compare together with the discussion of gender roles. As there are not enough younger (under 45 or under 50) people to compare to, this would be worth studying in the future. Furthermore, the financial situation can be a variable that might change along the patients’ lifespan, which was not considered in the present study. Finally, there are other important factors that were not controlled for in this study, such as pain duration, family/social support, or non-binary subjects. As patients could be classified with both gender roles, very few testimonials were available for the text mining analysis for those who played only one of the roles. Surprisingly, OUD’s quality of life and socialisation were better than for no-OUD despite their simpler lexicon. All this should be considered in future analyses as well as performing more complex text mining analysis . Given the differences shown, we will continue to work with Natural Language Processing, and analysis of the emotional impact of content. All of these would help to understand this OUD. complex population that used to come with lived childhood experiences, a variety of very different pain diagnoses, as well as a vast range of mental health diagnoses and psychosocial histories. Opioids, known for their potent pain-relieving characteristics, are essential in pain management, but they come with substantial drawbacks such as dependence. Our findings show a strong influence of OUD on narratives, together with a significant impact of sex, gender roles and economic status on CNCP. Moreover, pain-related gender stereotypes may still limit early and equal pain care access for women with a stronger impact on their mental health. These data highlight the need for an interdisciplinary patient management with CNCP even more when an OUD has been diagnosed.

Eyes are always firmly on the prized at TEFAF, as visitors weigh up potential acquisitions in whatever niche they collect, whether 18th-century snuffboxes or Flemish tapestries. But there’s also always time for a glass of something and some sushi in the aisles, and to discuss the prevailing trade winds, including fierce new import/export tariffs. AXA, JP Morgan, Ruinart and Alaïa were key sponsors in this edition, bringing a dose of fashion, luxury, investment and tech into the nexus.

In an effort to woo the new-generation client, galleries were working hard to blend and merge genres, whether that be art nouveau glass and tribal art, or new makers with ancient artisans, in booths that delivered a distinctly domestic appeal, complete with parquet floors and library walls. Such arresting juxtapositions inspire collectors to recalibrate their own domestic environments.

‘In Paris, we held a show last year called “Serendipity” with mixed genres and it worked so well that here at TEFAF, we are continuing that idea,’ said Lucas Ratton, of the eponymous Paris gallery, founded by his great uncle, that was showcasing jewel-coloured art nouveau glass alongside its speciality, tribal art. The booth with its dark green walls, bookshelves and seating evoked a stylish abode. ‘People feel the resonance and it piques curiosity,’ said Ratton.

For Francis Sultana, director and CEO of David Gill Gallery, it was a chance to show off contemporary works and the furniture of German maker Valentin Loellmann, known for his sinuous pieces fusing metal, stained wood and olive velvet in curvilinear forms. ‘All art was once contemporary and the work attracts new customers. Between the museum-quality antiquities, clients can find the relevance and we want to open their eyes,’ said Gill, applauding the fair’s rigorous vetting and educational approach.

At Stuart Lochhead Sculpture, things looked lively with a baroque sculpture by Alessandro Algardi (1598-1654), Executioner (Bozzetto for the Beheading of St Paul in the Church of San Paolo Maggiore, Bologna) (c. 1634), sold to a private collection in America for in the region of €2 million. The display was juxtaposed with exquisite floral works by Shota Suzuki (b. 1987), including a delicate Camellia in copper, silver and gold powder with an asking price of €9,500. The flower studies next to religious relics were a neat marriage of past and contemporary orthodox and pantheistic faiths. Five of Suzuki’s wall sculptures were sold on the first day.

Ceramics are a relatively low entry point compared to old masters and here Pierre Marie Giraud gallery excelled with a mix of contemporary ceramicists including Takayuki Sakiyama, crackled glaze glass mushroom lamps by Jos Devriendt and furniture by Herzog & de Meuron. ‘People have been collecting ceramics for civilisations – it is one of the most ancient expressions of art and it is exciting to see the growing taste. We are in a small, lucky place in a crazy world,’ said director Cedric Beukels.

While prices can reach well into the multi-millions, to attract new customers, Dominique Savelkoul, the new managing director of TEFAF, is launching initiatives to attract a new generation of collectors, including an interactive map that spotlights work under €20,000. Ancient Roman and Greek antiquities can offer comparative value, with a black glazed Greek amphora at Charles Ede for €7000 and an Egyptian carnelian falcon pendant jewellery at €2,000 from Kallos Gallery.

In the hierarchy of painting, Alberto Giacometti, Gerhard Richter, Tracey Emin, Titian, Ai Weiwei, Hokusai, and Jan Davidsz. de Heem are among the fine art highlights from across the centuries. The most expensive artwork this year is a 1965 Picasso painting, Les Dormeurs, with an asking price of $50 million at Landau Fine Art. There was a beeline for Richard Saltoun’s solo display of surrealist paintings and drawings by the Palestinian-born Lebanese artist Juliana Seraphim (1934-2005), chiming with the desire for underplayed female artists.

In another life, I’d have gone home with the dreamy metalwork bed with phoenix and cabbage-leaf motifs by Claude Lalanne at Galerie Lefebvre, on the market for €250,000. With its sheepskin and wool coverings, in a room set featuring an Alberto Giacometti wall sculpture of a white bird, it was love at first sight. ‘There is a good amount of work by Les Lalannes around but not too much, and the bed is one of a kind. The appeal is so universal: it is humorous, joyful, surreal,’ says Yana Mihailuka of Galerie Lefebvre, Paris. Architect Peter Marino, the Rothschilds and Yves Saint Laurent are among the roll call of patrons past and present. Sweet collector dreams.

Energy Fantasy Versus Reality In Woke-Land -- Part III

Manhattan Contrarian ^ | 16 Mar, 2025 | Francis Menton

Posted on by MtnClimber

JP Morgan Chase — that’s the largest bank in the country. It has been headed for almost 20 years by celebrity CEO Jamie Dimon. For much of the 20 years, Chase and Dimon have been known for their fealty to woke orthodoxies, at least in their official pronouncements. For example, here is a Forbes piece from October 2020 citing Dimon on the subject of “systemic racism.” (Pithy quote: “Systemic racism is a tragic part of America’s history. . . . It’s long past time that society addresses racial inequities in a more tangible, meaningful way.”)

The fealty to woke orthodoxies has in the past extended in particular to the subject of “climate change.” In April 2021 JPM put out a big announcement of plans to facilitate investment of some $2.5 trillion in what they called “climate action and sustainable development.” In October 2021, JPM joined the so-called Net Zero Banking Alliance, then being organized by the UN (led by Mark Carney), promising to starve fossil fuels of investment capital in order to reduce CO2 emissions.

But meanwhile, over at J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, they have a guy named Michael Cembalest, who currently has the title Chairman of Market and Investment Strategy. For some 15 years, Cembalest has put out an annual Report called the Annual Energy Paper. I have covered a couple of Cembalest’s prior reports, here for 2021, and here for 2022. The titles of both those posts included the words “Fantasy Versus Reality In Woke-Land.” Cembalest is just out with the 2025 version of his Annual Energy Paper, so consider this to be Part III of this series.

These Reports by Cembalest are far from perfect. At a basic level, the Reports accept the ideas that there is a real energy transition going on, that it is somehow important, and that use of fossil fuels must eventually be eliminated. I don’t know if Cembalest really believes those things himself, or if accepting them for purposes of your public reports is the price of holding a highly-paid job at JPM. Either way, while I consider the failure to question those ideas to be a major flaw of these Reports, that failure does not prevent Cembalest from taking a serious and realistic look at many aspects of the supposed energy transition that are completely failing.

I’ll start with a couple of sections of this year’s Report that I consider to be the strongest: those covering hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).

Hydrogen

Cembalest’s section on hydrogen, beginning at page 45, is titled “Frydrogen: the cancellation of green hydrogen projects when exposed to the sunlight of energy math.” The reason for use of the word “fry”: “[M]any hydrogen projects are being fried (terminated) since the energy math didn’t work.”

Cembalest quotes Hanns Neubert in the June 2024 German MIT Technology Review:

“Electrolyzers, which do not exist, are supposed to use surplus electricity, which does not exist, to feed hydrogen into a network that does not exist in order to operate power plants that do not exist. Alternatively, the hydrogen is to be transported via ships and harbors, which do not exist, from supplier countries, which - you guessed it - also do not exist.”

There is a long list of some 12 insurmountable obstacles standing in the way of a green hydrogen economy. My favorite:

The green hydrogen economy barely exists despite mountains of taxpayer subsidies promoting supply. In the US, for example: a production tax credit of $3 per kg is equivalent to $91 per MWh based on the energy content of hydrogen (i.e., greater than wholesale electricity prices which averaged between $30 and $50 per MWh in 2024).

(Note that the $91/MWh tax credit for green hydrogen is just the subsidized portion of the cost of making the fuel; the $30-50/MWh wholesale cost of electricity includes all elements of making the electricity, not just the fuel.)

CCS

In a section on CCS on page 19 of the Report, Cembalest correctly takes note of the fact that after decades of hype, CCS has gone absolutely nowhere. He calls the CCS “citation-to-usage ratio” (that is, the number of citations of CCS in academic papers divided by the actual operating capacity of CCS facilities) “the highest ratio in the history of science.” A chart shows current U.S. capacity of operating CCS facilities at about 0.1% of CO2 emissions. If all planned facilities actually get built (highly unlikely based on experience), then the percent of emissions captured would go to around 0.8% of emissions.

Another interesting chart shows that CCS facilities that have been built capture far from all of the CO2 emissions from the plant in question, despite consuming substantial portions of the energy production of the plant. Here is a portion of that chart:

Capturing 55-75% of the emissions of a coal power plant is never going to satisfy the environmental zealots. So what’s the point?

OK, those were the strong parts of the Report. Let’s get to the fundamental flaw.

Solar power

The biggest theme of this year’s Report is “Heliocentrism.” The title of the Executive Summary of the Report is “Heliocentrism and the speed of the energy transition.” Why the term “heliocentrism”? “For purposes of this paper, heliocentrism refers to the view that rapid growth in solar power and energy storage are at the heart of the energy transition, and that new investment in complementary thermal power generation is no longer required.”

Cembalest says that there are “believers in heliocentrism,” apparently lots of them, and lays out their case for them:

Believers in heliocentrism point to rapid growth in global solar capacity which more than doubled over the last three years. If BNEF projections are correct, solar capacity will double again from 2024 to 2027. Solar is now the dominant form of global capacity additions, comprising 60% of new capacity in 2024 and by our estimates ~75% in 2027. According to Carbon Brief, the International Energy Agency underestimated solar capacity growth for years and has been trying to catch up as shown below. Globally, the combination of wind and solar power generation has soared past nuclear and should surpass hydropower in 2025.

Cembalest then states that “there are a couple of ‘buts’ to keep in mind.” That’s putting it mildly! As the “buts,” Cembalest mentions that solar facilities have annual capacity factors in the range of 15-20%, and that producing electricity from solar panels does not solve the issue of non-electrified uses of energy, like transportation, industry, and most space heating. Fair enough. But he never gets to the biggest problem, which is dealing with the problem of intermittency as the penetration of solar generation into the grid increases.

The problem of energy storage is barely mentioned. There is this on page 5:

EIA analysts I spoke with cite a “staggering” amount of battery storage being added to the US grid: another 38 GW by 2027 on top of 22.5 GW already in place. This suggests that some natural gas peaker and baseload plants could eventually be displaced.

Well, how “staggering” is that? It’s really discouraging that Cembalest does not even use the correct units for describing battery capacity (which are watt-hours rather than watts). But assume that we are talking about standard 4-hour lithium-ion batteries. A few minutes of simple arithmetic would show that this “staggering” amount of storage is a tiny fraction of what would be needed to back up a predominantly solar electrical grid. The U.S. used 4,086 TWh, or 4,086,000 GWh, of electricity in 2024. Dividing by 8760 (hours in a year), that’s 466 GWh every hour. 38 + 22.5 GW of batteries would total 60.5 GW, times 4 hours’ duration would come to 242 GWh of storage. So, about half an hour’s worth. Full backup of a predominantly solar grid would take about 500 to 1000 hours of storage. So the “staggering” 242 GWh is around 0.05% - 0.1% of the storage that would be needed. An almost meaningless amount.

Cembalest’s conclusion is that while solar generation is increasing rapidly, it is only increasing “linearly,” which is not nearly fast enough to overtake all fossil fuel generation in any short number of years. Thus, “[A]s a general principle, . . . the US and Europe are a long way off from no longer needing both baseload and backup thermal capacity.”

Well, sorry Mike, but you’ve missed the big picture. If you had done the arithmetic, you could easily have seen that solar is not just “a long way off” from powering the grid without thermal backup; solar is never going to be the main source energy for a developed economy. You owed it to your clients to tell them that this can’t work, and there is a Green Energy Wall coming; but you failed.

Meanwhile, there is at least some reason to think that JPM at the highest levels has finally started to see reality and re-think its green energy commitments. Just in January, JPM quit the Net Zero Banking Alliance. Maybe by the time next year’s Report rolls around, the shackles will have been taken off Mr. Cembalest, and he can give his readers a dose of the truth.

The burning of methane, natural gas, is the bridge fuel to the future when ALL electric energy is produced from nuclear power sources, despite the cringing fears of those who still believe that all nuclear plants have the potential for another Chernobyl or Fukushima meltdown and radioactivity release. Small Modular Nuclear Reactors are somewhere in between design stages, test applications, and even some actual commercial adoption. They have the advantages of standardization, in that they may be built in a factory, shipped by rail or truck to destination, and be set up in a location close to the point of use. They are scalable and modular, so that when electricity demand expands (or contracts, an unlikely alternative) the units can be brought on line or taken off, as needed. It would be possible to minimize the reliance on grid structure over wide areas, and extend reliable, relatively cheap power to remote localities without the need for long transmission lines. Hydrogen may be technically feasible over time, as the excess electrical energy generated may be put to use to form free hydrogen on an economically sound basis, but use of hydrogen to propel a road vehicle may still be many years in the future. “Decarbonization” is a fake issue. Carbon dioxide is NOT a pollutant of earth’s atmosphere, but an essential part of the life cycle of every carbon-based organism that exists.

Energy Fantasy Versus Reality In Woke-Land -- Part III Manhattan Contrarian ^ | 16 Mar, 2025 | Francis Menton Posted on by MtnClimber JP Morgan Chase — that’s the largest bank in the country. It has been headed for almost 20 years by celebrity CEO Jamie Dimon. For much of the 20 years, Chase and Dimon have been known for their fealty to woke orthodoxies, at least in their official pronouncements. For example, here is a Forbes piece from October 2020 citing Dimon on the subject of “systemic racism.” (Pithy quote: “Systemic racism is a tragic part of America’s history. . . . It’s long past time that society addresses racial inequities in a more tangible, meaningful way.”) The fealty to woke orthodoxies has in the past extended in particular to the subject of “climate change.” In April 2021 JPM put out a big announcement of plans to facilitate investment of some $2.5 trillion in what they called “climate action and sustainable development.” In October 2021, JPM joined the so-called Net Zero Banking Alliance, then being organized by the UN (led by Mark Carney), promising to starve fossil fuels of investment capital in order to reduce CO2 emissions. But meanwhile, over at J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, they have a guy named Michael Cembalest, who currently has the title Chairman of Market and Investment Strategy. For some 15 years, Cembalest has put out an annual Report called the Annual Energy Paper. I have covered a couple of Cembalest’s prior reports, here for 2021, and here for 2022. The titles of both those posts included the words “Fantasy Versus Reality In Woke-Land.” Cembalest is just out with the 2025 version of his Annual Energy Paper, so consider this to be Part III of this series. These Reports by Cembalest are far from perfect. At a basic level, the Reports accept the ideas that there is a real energy transition going on, that it is somehow important, and that use of fossil fuels must eventually be eliminated. I don’t know if Cembalest really believes those things himself, or if accepting them for purposes of your public reports is the price of holding a highly-paid job at JPM. Either way, while I consider the failure to question those ideas to be a major flaw of these Reports, that failure does not prevent Cembalest from taking a serious and realistic look at many aspects of the supposed energy transition that are completely failing. I’ll start with a couple of sections of this year’s Report that I consider to be the strongest: those covering hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). Hydrogen Cembalest’s section on hydrogen, beginning at page 45, is titled “Frydrogen: the cancellation of green hydrogen projects when exposed to the sunlight of energy math.” The reason for use of the word “fry”: “any hydrogen projects are being fried (terminated) since the energy math didn’t work.” Cembalest quotes Hanns Neubert in the June 2024 German MIT Technology Review: “Electrolyzers, which do not exist, are supposed to use surplus electricity, which does not exist, to feed hydrogen into a network that does not exist in order to operate power plants that do not exist. Alternatively, the hydrogen is to be transported via ships and harbors, which do not exist, from supplier countries, which - you guessed it - also do not exist.” There is a long list of some 12 insurmountable obstacles standing in the way of a green hydrogen economy. My favorite: The green hydrogen economy barely exists despite mountains of taxpayer subsidies promoting supply. In the US, for example: a production tax credit of $3 per kg is equivalent to $91 per MWh based on the energy content of hydrogen (i.e., greater than wholesale electricity prices which averaged between $30 and $50 per MWh in 2024). (Note that the $91/MWh tax credit for green hydrogen is just the subsidized portion of the cost of making the fuel; the $30-50/MWh wholesale cost of electricity includes all elements of making the electricity, not just the fuel.) CCS In a section on CCS on page 19 of the Report, Cembalest correctly takes note of the fact that after decades of hype, CCS has gone absolutely nowhere. He calls the CCS “citation-to-usage ratio” (that is, the number of citations of CCS in academic papers divided by the actual operating capacity of CCS facilities) “the highest ratio in the history of science.” A chart shows current U.S. capacity of operating CCS facilities at about 0.1% of CO2 emissions. If all planned facilities actually get built (highly unlikely based on experience), then the percent of emissions captured would go to around 0.8% of emissions. Another interesting chart shows that CCS facilities that have been built capture far from all of the CO2 emissions from the plant in question, despite consuming substantial portions of the energy production of the plant. Here is a portion of that chart: Capturing 55-75% of the emissions of a coal power plant is never going to satisfy the environmental zealots. So what’s the point? OK, those were the strong parts of the Report. Let’s get to the fundamental flaw. Solar power The biggest theme of this year’s Report is “Heliocentrism.” The title of the Executive Summary of the Report is “Heliocentrism and the speed of the energy transition.” Why the term “heliocentrism”? “For purposes of this paper, heliocentrism refers to the view that rapid growth in solar power and energy storage are at the heart of the energy transition, and that new investment in complementary thermal power generation is no longer required.” Cembalest says that there are “believers in heliocentrism,” apparently lots of them, and lays out their case for them: Believers in heliocentrism point to rapid growth in global solar capacity which more than doubled over the last three years. If BNEF projections are correct, solar capacity will double again from 2024 to 2027. Solar is now the dominant form of global capacity additions, comprising 60% of new capacity in 2024 and by our estimates ~75% in 2027. According to Carbon Brief, the International Energy Agency underestimated solar capacity growth for years and has been trying to catch up as shown below. Globally, the combination of wind and solar power generation has soared past nuclear and should surpass hydropower in 2025. Cembalest then states that “there are a couple of ‘buts’ to keep in mind.” That’s putting it mildly! As the “buts,” Cembalest mentions that solar facilities have annual capacity factors in the range of 15-20%, and that producing electricity from solar panels does not solve the issue of non-electrified uses of energy, like transportation, industry, and most space heating. Fair enough. But he never gets to the biggest problem, which is dealing with the problem of intermittency as the penetration of solar generation into the grid increases. The problem of energy storage is barely mentioned. There is this on page 5: EIA analysts I spoke with cite a “staggering” amount of battery storage being added to the US grid: another 38 GW by 2027 on top of 22.5 GW already in place. This suggests that some natural gas peaker and baseload plants could eventually be displaced. Well, how “staggering” is that? It’s really discouraging that Cembalest does not even use the correct units for describing battery capacity (which are watt-hours rather than watts). But assume that we are talking about standard 4-hour lithium-ion batteries. A few minutes of simple arithmetic would show that this “staggering” amount of storage is a tiny fraction of what would be needed to back up a predominantly solar electrical grid. The U.S. used 4,086 TWh, or 4,086,000 GWh, of electricity in 2024. Dividing by 8760 (hours in a year), that’s 466 GWh every hour. 38 + 22.5 GW of batteries would total 60.5 GW, times 4 hours’ duration would come to 242 GWh of storage. So, about half an hour’s worth. Full backup of a predominantly solar grid would take about 500 to 1000 hours of storage. So the “staggering” 242 GWh is around 0.05% - 0.1% of the storage that would be needed. An almost meaningless amount. Cembalest’s conclusion is that while solar generation is increasing rapidly, it is only increasing “linearly,” which is not nearly fast enough to overtake all fossil fuel generation in any short number of years. Thus, “s a general principle, . . . the US and Europe are a long way off from no longer needing both baseload and backup thermal capacity.” Well, sorry Mike, but you’ve missed the big picture. If you had done the arithmetic, you could easily have seen that solar is not just “a long way off” from powering the grid without thermal backup; solar is never going to be the main source energy for a developed economy. You owed it to your clients to tell them that this can’t work, and there is a Green Energy Wall coming; but you failed. Meanwhile, there is at least some reason to think that JPM at the highest levels has finally started to see reality and re-think its green energy commitments. Just in January, JPM quit the Net Zero Banking Alliance. Maybe by the time next year’s Report rolls around, the shackles will have been taken off Mr. Cembalest, and he can give his readers a dose of the truth.

To: MtnClimber The burning of methane, natural gas, is the bridge fuel to the future when ALL electric energy is produced from nuclear power sources, despite the cringing fears of those who still believe that all nuclear plants have the potential for another Chernobyl or Fukushima meltdown and radioactivity release. Small Modular Nuclear Reactors are somewhere in between design stages, test applications, and even some actual commercial adoption. They have the advantages of standardization, in that they may be built in a factory, shipped by rail or truck to destination, and be set up in a location close to the point of use. They are scalable and modular, so that when electricity demand expands (or contracts, an unlikely alternative) the units can be brought on line or taken off, as needed. It would be possible to minimize the reliance on grid structure over wide areas, and extend reliable, relatively cheap power to remote localities without the need for long transmission lines. Hydrogen may be technically feasible over time, as the excess electrical energy generated may be put to use to form free hydrogen on an economically sound basis, but use of hydrogen to propel a road vehicle may still be many years in the future. “Decarbonization” is a fake issue. Carbon dioxide is NOT a pollutant of earth’s atmosphere, but an essential part of the life cycle of every carbon-based organism that exists. by 3 posted onby alloysteel ( Divergence is not at all the same thing as diversity.)

JP Morgan,"With Southwest’s Big Change, It’s Time to Rethink the Network","Thanks to Southwest’s elimination of its differentiators, both United CEO Scott Kirby and Delta President Glen Hauenstein said last week that in competitive markets, Southwest’s customers are up for grabs. Scott took things further in his chat at the JP Morgan Industrials Conference as he explained what should happen next.

I think the far bigger thing… it’s the slaying of a sacred cow. It’s one of the two big things that get Southwest back to industry-leading margin, that and stop flying places that lose money. Those who should be willing to slay one, maybe want to slay two, I don’t know.

Southwest wants to lean on its people as being the big difference, but it’s really going to be about price and schedule since it has no other tangible advantages. So maybe that second sacred cow is on the table. In a price-and-schedule world, I decided to take a swing at some Cirium data to try to think about the airline’s network.

For the legacy carriers, the key has always been about dominating your markets. Yes, there are smaller competitive markets, but being #1 in a big city matters. It’s a version of the vaunted S-curve at work.

So what if we thought about Southwest’s network from that perspective? I’m assuming, importantly, that the airline still only has 737s and hasn’t branched out, and it hasn’t considered major changes to its product beyond what’s already been announced. If those things change, well, that changes the equation entirely.

I started by looking at July 2025 seats for every market Southwest served, and I do mean “market” and not “airport.” In other words, it’s Chicago, not Midway. Anywhere you see a city name with multiple airports, it’s meant to include the metro area because that’s what really matters.

Then, I started cutting markets out that didn’t matter. I threw out international and San Juan flying since those are just spokes for travelers from the lower 48, at least they are in the Southwest network. And long-haul isn’t a helpful comparison. I did the same for the ski markets in Montrose and Steamboat Springs. It’s possible some of those should go and some should stay, but they should only stay in support of the market at the other end of the route.

There was the issue of Hawaiʻi, but I decided to shelve it and ignore. That too is not a huge part of the business, but it is more than just a destination with all that interisland flying. It’s a distraction from the key task at hand, so let’s just pretend it doesn’t exist.

With that, I could focus on the main parts of the network, and I came up with this map that will need more explanation:

Map was created using Doughton Data Solutions service. doughtondata.com

Let’s start with the size of the dots. Those are based entirely on how many seats Southwest has departing from the city during that month:

Biggest (e.g. Las Vegas): > 500,000 seats (~100 daily departures or more)

Big (e.g. Sacramento): 250,000 to 499,999 seats (~50-99 daily departures)

Smaller (e.g. Reno): 100,000 to 249,999 seats (~20-49 daily departures)

Smallest (e.g. Lubbock): < 100,000 seats (~20 daily departures or less)

That’s the easy part, but what about the colors? I decided to look at a couple of metrics. First, anything in gray is a market where Southwest is not #1. We’ll talk more about those later.

For the other three colors, I looked at a combination of seat share vs the #2 airline as well as the number of destinations that Southwest serves from that city.

Red: Strong on both metrics

Blue: Strong on at least one of the metrics

Yellow: Not strong on either metric

So what does this tell us? Well, nobody should be surprised that the strongest markets are those in the southern half of the country.

The Strengths

There are five markets that are both big and where Southwest has a significant schedule advantage over the rest:

Austin

Las Vegas

Nashville

Orlando

St Louis

These are all good markets for the airline, though to me it’s Austin and Nashville that are the real long-term opportunities for future growth and dominance. Las Vegas falls in the same boat, but that’s more as an origin since most other airlines treat Vegas as a destination. It’s still a big city, and Southwest is the airline that caters to people there. That’s similar to Orlando, but I think of Orlando as a tougher market competitively. Then there’s St Louis.

St Louis may not be a huge growth market, but there may be some opportunity, especially if the airline tries to route connections through there more than Midway as it continues to build hubs. (I know, I know, I sound like AA management after buying TWA.) Also, this is the kind of market that’s the backbone of what makes Southwest work. It is a good-sized city that Southwest quickly moved to dominate when the old hub carrier left. Kansas City, though a little smaller, falls into that same bucket, and there are many other cities in red, big and small, from there to the south and west that Southwest will want to rely on.

But there are other important nodes in the network that aren’t so clear cut:

Baltimore/Washington

You’ll note that Baltimore/Washington is a big market where Southwest is #1, but the advantage is not as strong. BWI is dominated by Southwest, and it is the best way for the airline to serve the Northeast US and beyond with partnering opportunities. It’s no surprise that BWI is where the first interline partnership with Icelandair started off. While United and American are big and important players at Dulles and National respectively, BWI serves a separate but overlapping catchment. This should remain the focus point for the entire Northeast US.

The LA Basin

In LA, Southwest is far from #1 at LAX where the others are, but it dominates all of the secondary airports (Burbank, Long Beach, Ontario, and Orange County). It has enormous utility, and it has been reducing its reliance on LAX to focus further on secondary airports. This is a good strategy that will continue at least until Southwest has a better product, but LAX probably will be an increasingly unimportant part of the network compared to the secondaries.

Phoenix and the Valley of the Sun

I said I’d talk about the gray dots later, and now is that time. Despite being behind American in Phoenix, I still see that market as a winner for Southwest. American has neglected it until relatively recently and from a utility perspective, American has minimal long-haul at the airport. In other words, Southwest can be more competitive than in a place like DFW. There is also room to grow here as Southwest continues to fill out its relatively new concourse. Yes, it’s very close to Las Vegas, but the two can work in tandem as useful hubs in addition to the local traffic.

Steady Markets

While the markets listed above seem like good growth opportunities (if Southwest can get the gates), there are plenty that play an important role but may not be primed for growth. These are the markets that are gray dots. There is another airline in each city, but they tend to use a different airport.

Dallas Metroplex

There is no growth opportunity at Love Field, but Southwest will undoubtedly maintain its presence at its home airport. The question is whether it grows into other airports. I can see something like McKinney to the northeast of town, but I have a hard time thinking DFW is going to work when American flies to so many more destinations with so much more frequency.

Greater Houston

Southwest does have a nice position at Hobby airport, but it’s not going to ever beat United as the #1 in the city. Hobby and IAH are pretty far from each other, however, so Southwest isn’t leaving. I just don’t see where much growth is likely from there unless Southwest makes a concerted effort to go into non-leisure foreign markets. That doesn’t seem like the lowest-hanging fruit.

Chicagoland

There is no clear answer here. Yes, Southwest dominates Midway, but it continues to be dwarfed by United in Chicago overall. American may have fewer seats than Southwest, but it has more flights to more destinations. The move into O’Hare didn’t work, but the airline is in a strong position in Milwaukee to the north. That being said, if American scales back, all bets are off.

The Big Question Marks

While the ones above seem like relatively clear options, there are some that make me wonder if a more drastic decision should be made.

Denver

Southwest loved Denver when United wasn’t paying attention to local traffic and Frontier went ULCC. But now, United cares. It is growing quickly there, trying to win back the market, and Southwest with its single fleet type can’t have the same utility. With Frontier offering a product closer or even exceeding Southwest’s, it gets even tougher to reach the price-sensitive crowd. Denver is a huge station in the Southwest network, but it really only matters for connectivity into the Pac NW where the airline remains weak anyway.

The SF Bay Area

Southwest is big in Oakland and San Jose, but those markets are not what they once were, especially Oakland. SFO continues to be the leader of the pack, and United has been building its lead and making life more difficult for others. Instead, Southwest has been focusing its efforts on Sacramento which has been a much better and less competitive market that I think has good growth prospects. Does the Bay Area matter? Yes, but it’s fair to ask whether the operation is bigger than it should be.

San Diego

This may come as a surprise. After all, Southwest is #1 in the market, and new gates are coming online that will enable further growth. But this is also a market that Alaska covets. In fact, it’s the one important competitive market that the two airlines share. This does not mean Southwest should leave, but depending upon what Alaska does, Southwest may want to think about how big this station should be. Similar to the Bay Area, there is an argument to be made for focusing on short-haul where it does best.

The Slot Controlled Airports

The Northeast US is a real question mark. Should Southwest have operations as large as it has at LaGuardia and National? Or is it possible that it’s the slots that just make them think differently. (This is a problem for every airline.) There is likely too much service from Southwest in the Northeast across the board. This is an area most ripe for cutbacks.

What Does This Mean?

This is just a high level consideration of the network and undoubtedly those with internal data can do far better. But nobody should take this as gospel, it’s just opening a conversation. The question is now more about who has the stomach to make big changes now that the business model has changed.

Will people be willing to shrink or even pull the airline out of markets that don’t make sense any longer? Further, will Southwest consider new aircraft types that might enable different types of flying? Will Southwest have further product changes that would impact this? Would Southwest be willing to cede geography or is that a sign of weakness that can’t be tolerated? There are no simple answers here or the changes would have been made already.","Thanks to Southwest’s elimination of its differentiators, both United CEO Scott Kirby and Delta President Glen Hauenstein said last week that in competitive markets, Southwest’s customers are up for grabs.

After all, Southwest is #1 in the market, and new gates are coming online that will enable further growth. But this is also a market that Alaska covets. In fact, it’s the one important competitive market that the two airlines share. This does not mean Southwest should leave, but depending upon what Alaska does, Southwest may want to think about how big this station should be. Similar to the Bay Area, there is an argument to be made for focusing on short-haul where it does best. The Slot Controlled Airports The Northeast US is a real question mark. Should Southwest have operations as large as it has at LaGuardia and National? Or is it possible that it’s the slots that just make them think differently. (This is a problem for every airline.) There is likely too much service from Southwest in the Northeast across the board. This is an area most ripe for cutbacks. What Does This Mean? This is just a high level consideration of the network and undoubtedly those with internal data can do far better. But nobody should take this as gospel, it’s just opening a conversation. The question is now more about who has the stomach to make big changes now that the business model has changed. Will people be willing to shrink or even pull the airline out of markets that don’t make sense any longer? Further, will Southwest consider new aircraft types that might enable different types of flying? Will Southwest have further product changes that would impact this? Would Southwest be willing to cede geography or is that a sign of weakness that can’t be tolerated? There are no simple answers here or the changes would have been made already.","the slaying of a sacred cow is one of the two big things that get Southwest back to industry-leading margin, that and stop flying places that lose money . it’s really going to be about price and schedule since it has no other tangible advantages . the key has always been about dominating your legacy carriers .","southwest industry, legacy carriers, sacred cow"

Mumbai: After Adani Green Energy (AGEL) refinanced a $1.06 billion construction facility which was due March 2025, bond analysts are recommending that investors suggest targeted bond buybacks to the Adani Group to reduce risk and manage the large volume of debt coming due.The new facility is reportedly borrowed at a weighted life of 19 years, and now carries a funding cost of 9.2%. The loan it refinanced was taken in 2021 to develop wind-solar hybrid projects.""While the successful outcome of AGEL's loan refinancing is well expected by the market, the lower cost of AGEL's debt refinancing is an encouraging read for the group's recent developments,"" Nomura wrote in its latest credit report . ""We recommend investors to provide suggestions to the Adani Group to conduct bond buybacks for facilitating the Adani risk recycling and addressing the bond maturity wall across the Adani complex,"" it said.On the ongoing US regulatory developments as well as long-running investigations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCAP) and other enforcement actions involving AGEL, analysts said recent shifts in the US are positive, especially the Trump administration's February 25 executive order directing the Department of Justice to pause FCPA enforcement until new guidelines are issued.The Adani Group's US dollar bonds have rebound following a positive update by Fitch Ratings. The Adani Green 4.625% 2039 and 6.2% 2042 bonds have moved up 2 basis points after the update.After Adani Green's construction facility of $1.06 billion, Adani Airport Holdings is facing two repayments-$250 million in May 2025 and $150 million in September 2025.

JP Morgan,Is Descartes Systems Group Inc. (DSGX) the Best Mid Cap Tech Stock to Buy Now?,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Mid Cap Tech Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Descartes Systems Group Inc. (NASDAQ:DSGX) stands against other best mid cap tech stocks to buy now.

In an interview with CNBC, Thomas Martin, the Senior Portfolio Manager at GLOBALT Investments, highlighted that tech earnings are slowing and policy risks are rising. However, he remains positive on tech stocks as underlying fundamentals are strong. But he emphasized that diversification is key. He pointed out that while big tech hasn’t lost its luster yet, maybe it is time to look elsewhere.

Most investors focus on the big tech names like the Mag 7. As a result, there is a smaller probability of a mismatch between their valuation and their intrinsic value. The smaller tech names are usually overlooked. Hence, some of these stocks could offer deep value. Some US mid-cap stocks are deeply undervalued.

According to JP Morgan, US large-cap stocks have returned 12.6% annually over the past 10 years. Meanwhile, the same set of stocks have seen an EPS (earnings per share) growth of only 6.9% on an annualized basis, according to JP Morgan.

On the other hand, US mid-cap stocks have returned 9.3% annually over the past 10 years, with an EPS growth of 9.9% annually over the last 10 years. The large-cap stocks have seen superior returns despite lower earnings growth compared to mid-cap stocks in the same period. This underscores the value proposition of mid-cap tech stocks.

In the CNBC interview, Thomas Martin acknowledged that the Trump administration’s policies might have some effect on inflation and interest rates. However, according to Martin, those effects might be muted. That said, interest rates remain high, and smaller companies usually underperform during high interest rate regimes.

According to a quarterly report released by Pathstone in January 2025, smaller companies are facing several risks, including policy uncertainty and rising Treasury yields. As a result, while mid-cap tech stocks have potential, they need to be chosen carefully.

Mid-cap tech companies with strong balance sheets and decent profitability are better equipped to navigate through the high-interest rate period compared to those that are highly leveraged and have low profitability.

JP Morgan,"Trump shrugs off stock market slump, but economic warning signs loom","During Donald Trump’s first term as US president, he regularly referred to rising stock markets as evidence of the success of his economic policies. “Highest Stock Market EVER”, Trump wrote on social media in 2017 after record gains. “That doesn’t just happen!”

And after securing a second term in November 2024, some of Trump’s close advisers told the New York Times that the president “sees the market as a barometer of his success and abhors the idea that his actions might drive down stock prices”.

This, in addition to a broader economic policy agenda committed to lower regulation and significant tax cuts, had Wall Street investors bullish about their prospects under the new Trump administration.

But fears of an escalating trade war have seen the S&P 500, an index of the leading 500 publicly traded companies in the US, drop more than 10% from its February 2025 high. A decline of this magnitude in a major index is what professional traders refer to as a “correction”. In less than a month, roughly US$5 trillion (£3.9 trillion) has been wiped off the value of US stocks.

So, what exactly is driving down stock prices? Economists cite the president’s brinkmanship, as well as his start-stop approach to tariffs with Canada and Mexico, as having rattled global investors. Some commentators believe this “chaotic” trade agenda has created huge uncertainty for consumers, investors and businesses.

In view of such policies, a recent JP Morgan report said that US economic policy was “tilting away from growth”, and put the chances of a US recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year. Moody’s Analytics has upped the odds of a US recession from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs as a key factor driving the downturn in its outlook.

Any economic downturn would have an adverse impact on the profitability of US corporations, and the declining share prices reflect the negative outlook from investors.

So far, the Trump administration appears unfazed by the US stock market decline. In an address to Congress on March 4, Trump declared his use of tariffs was all about making America rich again. “There will be a little disturbance, but we’re okay with that,” he said.

The White House has, since then, announced that some short-term pain may be necessary for Trump to implement his trade agenda successfully, which is designed to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US.

So, should we read this economic turbulence as a temporary blip? Or is it symptomatic of a more fundamental shift in the US economy?

Change of strategy

Stephen Miran, who was recently confirmed as chairman of Trump’s council of economic advisers, wrote a paper in November 2024 titled: A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System. The paper gives us an insight into the Trump administration’s wider economic strategy.

It sets out Trump’s desire “to reform the global trading system and put American industry on fairer ground vis-a-vis the rest of the world”. Miran cites persistent US dollar overvaluation as the root cause of economic imbalances.

Miran does not believe that tariffs are inflationary, and argues that their use during Trump’s first presidential term had little discernible macroeconomic consequences. He does concede that tariffs may eventually lead to an appreciation – or further overvaluation – of the US dollar. However, Miran sees the extent of that appreciation as “debatable”.

He sees tariffs as a tool for leverage in trade negotiations. The administration could, for example, agree to a reduction in tariffs in exchange for significant investment is the US by key trading partners. China investing in car manufacturing in the US is specifically mentioned in his analysis.

Miran also states his belief that tariffs can be used to raise tax revenues from foreigners in order to retain low tax rates on American citizens.

Some economists agree that the US dollar is overvalued. A combination of its role as the world’s reserve currency, as well as the attractiveness of the US economy as an investment destination, fuels demand for the US dollar and makes it stronger.

A strong US dollar has made American manufacturing exports less competitive. This has cost American jobs. The “rust belt” states of the north-eastern and mid-western US have experienced a decline in manufacturing employment over the past 40 years, which is evidence of this.

However, it is worth noting that the many US manufacturers who import manufactured parts or components to make their products do benefit from a stronger dollar. This is because it makes the parts and materials they are importing cheaper. US mortgage holders and investors also benefit from a stronger dollar through lower interest rates on loans.

Steven Englander, the head of research and strategy at Standard Chartered bank, believes there are some contradictions in the Trump administration’s approach.

In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Englander said: “The problem for the new administration is that it simultaneously wants a weaker dollar, a reduced trade deficit, capital inflows, and the dollar to remain the key currency in international reserves and payments.”

Reduced trade deficits and capital inflows would typically strengthen the US dollar, as does its position as the world’s reserve currency.

As Miran says in his paper: “There is a path by which the Trump administration can reconfigure the global trading and financial systems to America’s benefit. But it is narrow, and will require careful planning, precise execution, and attention to steps to minimise adverse consequences.”

Only time will tell whether the Trump administration can successfully navigate this “narrow” path. In the meantime, the recent turbulence in US stock prices appears to be acceptable to the Trump administration in their pursuit of reforming the global financial system.","During Donald Trump’s first term as US president, he regularly referred to rising stock markets as evidence of the success of his economic policies. “Highest Stock Market EVER”, Trump wrote on social media in 2017 after record gains. “That doesn’t just happen!” And after securing a second term in November 2024, some of Trump’s close advisers told the New York Times that the president “sees the market as a barometer of his success and abhors the idea that his actions might drive down stock prices”.
